# About me

My name is Daniel Leech. I am a PHP developer since 2007. I live somewhere in
Europe.

I created [a benchmarking framwork](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) and
[a PHP completion and refactoring tool](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor)
and was previously active in the [Symfony CMF
project](https://cmf.symfony.com) and related PHPCR eco-system. Worked on the
[Sulu CMF](https://sulu.io) for a year or so.

Currently work at [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com).

Interested in cool stuff and can be found on
