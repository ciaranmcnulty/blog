# About me

My name is Daniel Leech. I am a PHP developer living somewhere in Europe.
Probably. I have been working as a developer for over 10 years. I created the
following terrible open source projects:
[PHPBench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) and
[PHPActor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor).

Interested in all the cool things.
