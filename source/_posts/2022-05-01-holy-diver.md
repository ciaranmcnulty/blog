Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
```

This is this months _effort_ at recording a song. I tried to record a song
about the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) on Saturday, but it
didn't succeed, so I decided to record a cover of a song I've been listening
to on repeat for the past 3 weeks.

I'm not very happy with it, in particular I'm not happy with my voice - I'm
incapabable of singing, especially in this vocal range ðŸ˜…. I am siniging
weakly at the top of my range, and there are some notes which I simply cannot
reach.

I feel sorry for my neighbours listening to me singing at the top of my voice
for more than a few hours.

Still, it was an interesting excercise. To begin with I tried to be faithful
with the drums, but when I realised how long the song was I started to copy
and paste more, by the end of the song I had largely given up.

If anything it made me appreciate the song more.
