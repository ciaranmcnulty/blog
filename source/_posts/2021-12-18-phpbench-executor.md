title: Hrtime and Loops
categories: [php,phpbench]
---
PHPBench currently samples the time taken (in microseconds) to run code around a loop.

This post aims to provide some insight into:

- If there is a benefit to using a loop (`@Revs`) when taking a time sample.
- The value of using `hrtime` instead of `microtime`.

Background
----------

PHPBench samples the time taken for your code to run. The default executor
does this by iterating over your code a number of times (`@Revs`) and
dividing the total time in microseconds (i.e. `microtime`) by the number of
revolutions to provide the time measurement (the time sample for an
`@Iteration`).

This essentially boils down to the following code (the _sampling script_):

```
$start = microtime(true);
for ($r = 0; $r < $revs; $r++) {
    $yourBenchmark->callSubject();
}
$end = microtime(true);
$sampleTime = ( - $start) / $revs;
```

This process is repeated according to the number of `@Iterations` specified
and from these samples we calculate the most probable value (the _KDE mode_).

Originally the loop was intended to provide better results with
micro-benchmarks (very fast code can finish in less than a microsecond) but
since version 7.3 (November 2018) PHP has supported `hrtime` which allows you
to sample the current time at `nanosecond` resolution.

What difference does the loop make? What difference does using `hrtime` make?
Let's find out with _science_ ðŸ¥³ (ahem..)

Setup
-----

Our benchmark will first of all run an empty method, and then run a sleeping
method which will sleep for gradually increasing times:

```php
    public function benchNoOp(): void
    {
    }

    /**
     * @ParamProviders({"provideSleep"})
     */
    public function benchSleep(array $params): void
    {
        usleep($params['sleep']);
    }
```

The sleep acts as an anchor against which we can compare PHPBench's
measurements.

All benchmarks were taken with PHP8.1 with Xdebug turned off, the overview is
as follows:

```

Smallest Measurable Time
------------------------

PHPbench would like to minimise the overhead involved in taking a measurement, what
is the absolute minimum time we can measure in PHP?

The following script compares `microtime` (microseconds) and `hrtime` (nanoseconds scaled to microseconds):

```
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {

    $start = hrtime(true);
    $end = hrtime(true);
    echo sprintf("Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) %f | ", (($end - $start) / 1000));

    $start = microtime(true);
    $end = microtime(true);
    echo sprintf("Min microtime interval (Î¼s) %f\n", (($end - $start) * 1E6));
}
```

Produces:

```
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.270000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.039000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.033000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.018000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.017000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.019000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.019000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.018000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.019000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
Min hrtime interval (Î¼s) 0.019000 | Min microtime interval (Î¼s) 0.000000
```

So we can see that `microtime` is incapable of measuring the minimum interval
because it's less than 1 microsecond. We also see that it takes 2-4 iterations
for the `hrtime` sampler to settle down.

Microtime vs. Hrtime with 10 revs
---------------------------------

This compares the original microtime executor and the new `hrtime` executor with 10 revolutions, i.e.

```php
$start = // capture current time
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $benchmark->callSubject();
}
$end = // capture current time
$totalTime = ($end - $start) / 10;
```

The results:

+--------------+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+
```

Above we see that the time for a no-op is captured with `hrtime`, although it
seems almost completely eliminated by the loop.

Beyond the no-op, there seems to be no difference between the `microtime` and
`hrtime` executors.

Microtime vs. Hrtime with 1 rev
----------------------------------

The same as above but for only 1 loop, the script is something like:

```php
$start = // capture current time
for ($i = 0; $i < 1; $i++) {
    $benchmark->callSubject();
}
$end = // capture current time
$totalTime = ($end - $start) / 10;
```

And the results:

+--------------+---------------+--------------------+--------------------+
```

The `hrtime` loop is increased but results remain the same with 1
revoltion/loop.

Hrtime with no loop
-------------------

The new executor allows you to define how the script is built. Let's remove
the `for` loop entirely:

```
+--------------+---------------+--------------------+
| subject      | sleep         | Tag: hrtimenoloop  |
+--------------+---------------+--------------------+
| benchNoOp.0  | 0.000Î¼s       | 0.312Î¼s (Â±2.28%)   |
| benchSleep.0 | 0.000Î¼s       | 55.152Î¼s (Â±1.97%)  |
| benchSleep.1 | 50.000Î¼s      | 105.246Î¼s (Â±0.36%) |
| benchSleep.2 | 100.000Î¼s     | 155.254Î¼s (Â±0.69%) |
| benchSleep.3 | 500.000Î¼s     | 589.230Î¼s (Â±0.89%) |
| benchSleep.4 | 1,000.000Î¼s   | 1.090ms (Â±1.42%)   |
| benchSleep.5 | 5,000.000Î¼s   | 5.178ms (Â±0.93%)   |
| benchSleep.6 | 10,000.000Î¼s  | 10.181ms (Â±0.43%)  |
| benchSleep.7 | 20,000.000Î¼s  | 20.195ms (Â±0.32%)  |
| benchSleep.8 | 50,000.000Î¼s  | 50.197ms (Â±0.08%)  |
| benchSleep.9 | 100,000.000Î¼s | 100.201ms (Â±0.03%) |
+--------------+---------------+--------------------+
```

So we see a small reduction in the no-op time as we might expect by removing
the for-loop.
