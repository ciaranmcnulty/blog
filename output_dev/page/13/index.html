            <p>Now sitting on the step of the sanitary block of a campsite by a Fjord
surrounded by high-rise mountains. The campsite cost 170kr (almost €18) for
the night, but the shower and cooker both cost 10kr each. I paid for the
shower, but used more of my increasingly precious camping gas to cook dinner.
The Wifi is at least free and so far I haven't encountered a campsite that
requires you to pay to use the toilet.</p>

<p>Last night was quiet and I woke early in the busy campsite, but remembered
that I needed to pay, so made to have my stuff packed up and ready at 8am -
but when I got to reception they didn't open until 9am. So I sat about doing
some work on my laptop and using the weak Wifi signal.</p>

<p>The plan was to head to Kristiansund today, but I quickly realised that it
wasn't achievable, it was at least 200km. But there were some target campsites
within a reasonable distance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-11/IMG_20180711_153644.jpg" alt="Reflection" /></p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>The weather was hot again, and my left hand still hasn't recovered from its
last bout of sunburn, so I wore my gloves all day. I only have a small amount
of sun cream, and am reluctant to buy more. I notice that today my nose is
also burnt.</p>

<p>I did another Norweigan lesson, lesson 19. I'm following it quite well, but
all my attempts at speaking Norwegian have ended in blank stares. I ask
"Vorstor du Engelsk?" <em>blank stare</em>, wait a beat, then "Do you speak English?"
and the answer is usually yes. Although I have encountered many more people
that don't speak English, especially ferry fare collectors.</p>

<p>I caught two ferries today, the first required me to wait for an hour and a
half. I had just passed a village park (which seemed to be the grounds of a
modern church) so I went back and sat down and had lunch and then dozed in the
sun for 45 minutes. Both ferries cost around €4.</p>

<p><em>First water fountain seen in Norway</em></p>

<p>I passed three sets of cycle tourers. One pair on a tandem and another who
looked very professional. They had fast bikes and no front or rear panniers.
The tent and other accessories were strapped lengthways at the back and at the
front for aerodynamics and the bikes were fast cycle-cross bikes. I passed and
waved, but didn't stop. They then overtook me at considerable speed. I
wondered if they had electric bikes - but it's just possible they were
actually cycling at that speed.</p>

<p>There was even more spectacular views today, especially when I took the ferry.</p>

<p>In the evenings I am writing these blog posts, eating and reading. When I
started as was reading "The Book Thief" and then started re-reading "The
Brothers Karamazov", the first time I read the Pevear-Volokhonsky translation,
this time it's the Victorian Constance Garrett version. I think I prefer the
Pevear version, but it has been many years. I started "Memoirs of a Geisha"
last night.</p>

<p><em>Three Hills</em></p>

<p>I will pass through Kristiansund tomorrow - it is on an island which has only
tunnel access, but it is not possible to cycle through it, so I imagine I will
need to get the bus. After that I will do one more nights camping and then
get to Trondheim, where I plan to stay in a hostel and then get the train to
Oslo and start making my way back to Germany.</p>

<p>The mosquitos and other bugs are becoming annoying while cycling towards the
end of the day, especially when cycling downhill. I have to either squint my
eyes to avoid "mosquito-eye" or angle the visor of my cap down so I can only
see the road immediately in front of me.</p>

            <p>I think it was the coldest night so far - relative to my sleeping bag and
comfort level. I didn't sleep great and had a hard time motivating myself to
get out of bed, but eventually I got out and had breakfast, did my business
and left the campsite. I looked for the old man I had spoken to the previous
evening who said, that if he was on reception he would show me the route to
Trondheim. I knew the route of course, because I have a map, but local
knowledge is always good. He wasn't there in any case.</p>

<p><em>Rolling, rolling, rolling</em></p>

<p>The mountains are getting bigger as I go north, today there have been two or
three descents where I sped up to 50-60kmph.</p>

<p>I diverged again from the cycle route, preferring the more mountainous,
shorter route to the longer (and presumably flatter) coastal route. But the
mountain pass wasn't so high, I measured only 280m, so in all I saved a time
and kilometers.</p>

<p><em>Hut and mountain</em></p>

<p>The first ferry crossing of the day was at Koparnes, when I was 2k from the
port I could see the ferry docking, and I knew I had missed it, but as I
closed in it was still there, and I rode as fast as I could for some distance
before it pulled away. Fortunately they ran every half hour.</p>

<p>The port had a small cabin with a power socket, so I plugged my laptop in and
worked for 20 minutes before jumping on the ferry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-10/IMG_20180710_140604.jpg" alt="Ferry port" /></p>

<p><em>Ferry port</em></p>

<p>On the ferry a man came round to each car and collected the fare, but he
seemed to miss me, and I had to go inside and find him to give him the fare
(which was around €3.50).</p>

<p>The next section went across one island, and there was a bridge to the next.</p>

<p>My destination today was still unclear, there was a campsite on the second
island, or, there was Ålesund - a largish town and tourist destination which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85lesund_Fire">burnt down completely</a> in
1904 and was rebuilt from scratch.</p>

<p>Ålesund was a bit further away, and if I couldn't get a direct ferry I would
need to cycle an additional 25.</p>

<p>Looking at the map, the campsite I had considered was up a 10km dead end, so
I would effectively lose 10km the next day, this wasn't really an option, so I
headed to the ferry port. Best case I could get a direct ferry to Ålesund,
worst case I would have to cycle the extra distance or wild camp.</p>

<p>When I got to the ferry port at Hareid there were road signs to Ålesund, which
I couldn't really understand. There was a regular car ferry, and I asked some
people at the port if it went to Ålesund, and they said it did - but I think
they misunderstood me, as when I boarded the ferry and asked a worker, he said
I should get off and get the <em>speed boat</em> to the right.</p>

<p>There was a waiting area, but I couldn't see any indication that it was for
Ålesund, and I asked several people until I understood that the boat would get
in at 19:00.</p>

<p>The boat didn't cost much, and only took 25 minutes to get to its destination
and it was passengers only (no cars).</p>

<p>In the town I made my way straight to the campsite, there was a Youth Hostel
on the way, but when I asked inside, they had no beds.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the campsite, the man said that they were full, but I could
try and squeeze my tent in front of the reception, by the road, or in the
regular tent place if there is space. It is apparently a very busy time.</p>

<p>Despite him saying that the regular tent place was full, there was ample space
for my tent and bike. They had a kitchen, and I just purchased a shower token
for 10kr (I didn't shower last night because of the fee).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-10/IMG_20180710_112721.jpg" alt="The road" /></p>

<p>My roaming data allowance has just run out, so now I have no mobile internet
and will be reliant on Wifi until I get back to Germany, but I will be in
Trondheim in a few days, and should be back in Germany in less than a week.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I am going to try and reach Kristiansund.</p>

<p>It had stopped raining when I woke up, and I slept quite well, only getting
out of bed at 7:50. I ate the little remaining museli I had and had my
mandatory coffee. It was the coldest it has been so far last night, and
pushed the confort limits of my sleeping bag (I slept almost fully clothed).</p>

<p>It was monday morning and I left the campsite, I was going to go in and ask if
they had any camping gaz, but there was a queue so I just left and went to the
supermarket 1km down the road, and did a "big shop" buying one pack of museli,
one pack of pasta, 2 cans of baked beans, a french baguette, a big bag of
mixed nuts, and a separate bag of salted peanuts. Probably other things too.
As I went to pay I noticed that I had stolen the shower-block card from the
campsite. This was bothersome.</p>

<p>It was only 1km back to the campsite, and I decided it was too late to return
it and carried on, it bothered me for the rest of the morning. It was only a
plastic card but I didn't know how much of an inconvenience it is to have one
taken, or if I should send it back. In retrospect I should have dropped it
back.</p>

<p>My first, and as it turns out, only, destination was Flora where I would get
the ferry to Smørhamn. The first part of the route went along the (relatively)
busy E5 main road. Then there was a 5km tunnel which I could not cycle down,
so I had to go over the mountain.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-09/IMG_20180709_114518.jpg" alt="View from the top" /></p>

<p><em>View from the top of the pass</em></p>

<p>The mountain pass was extremely quiet, not a single car passed me on the 1
hour (?) ascent. The scenery was magnificent and I could see patches of snow
on the surrounding mountains. Afterwards the pass descended and rejoined the
E5 which took me most of the way to Florø.</p>

<p><em>Mountain top tunnel</em></p>

<p>I had no idea when the ferry would leave, so I hurried straight to the ferry
port. When I got there I saw lots of parked cars, some fork-lift trucks, and
various administrative buildings - but nothing that I recognized as a
ferry port.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had just passed a Tourist Information center, so I went there
for advice, I was told that my boat left at 16:05, and that it also went to
Måløy.</p>

<p>My destination was an island and I was to cycle 20km over wriggly terrain to
reach another ferry port to Måloy. It would maybe be 18:30 by the time I got
to the ferry port, and then I didn't know how often they ran.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-09/IMG_20180709_125404.jpg" alt="On the E5 to Flora" /></p>

<p><em>On the E5 to Florø</em></p>

<p>I decided to skip the island and go straight to Måløy.</p>

<p>At 15:40 I was at the ferry port, and I could see people waiting in a
disorganized way. There were no signs that I could see indicating what was
happening or what one should do. I asked two girls that were waiting as a boat
pulled in "Are you waiting for a boat?" "Yes" "Is it going to Måløy?" "err,
no. this one goes to the small islands, if I were you I would walk over there",
she pointed, "and ask somebody".</p>

<p>I did, and the man helpfully asked his wife who confirmed that my ferry would
come in at 16:05 after their ferry which came in at 16:00.</p>

<p>The ferries from Florø were much smaller than the "road" ferries, they had
capacity for maybe 3 or 4 cars and 20 to 30 passengers.</p>

<p>On the ferry the ticket collector came around and I said "Måløy" - the second
stop. As my first destination came into view I felt pangs of regret. I looked
fantastic. The other reason I felt regret was because the ticket cost 360kr -
I'm sure it would have been cheaper to stop here and cycle to the other side.</p>

<p>But the ferry was also a good 1.75 hour journey and the scenery was
spectacular - if you like huge mountainous rock islands rising out of the sea.</p>

<p>When we landed there was another supermarket and I purchased another loaf of
bread (the french baguette is actually pretty poor value for money, it doesn't
last long) and replacement Tobasco sauce (tragically I had left my original
sauce in Bergen).</p>

<p>I cycled over the 1.6 bridge to the mainland (on the main road, it wasn't
busy at all). There was a camping nearby and it was around 18:00 so I decided
to just settle down for the day after doing only 75km or so, having spent time
waiting for and being on the ferry.</p>

<p>The signs for the campsite (Stienvik Camping) didn't feature a tent (just
caravan and bungalow) but I tried my luck anyway and turned off on a dead-end
lane for 2km to get there - they did have camping spaces, it did cost 175kr -
almost €19 - the most expensive so far.</p>

<p>The campsite is quite stunning however, and most of it is bungalows and
caravans, the camping section is separated from the rest of it and a very well
kept lawn by the sea. I am the only camper and it is very quiet.</p>

<p><em>VIM by the sea</em></p>

<p>I made progress on my soup recipe by adding an onion - lentils, vegetable
broth, pasta and a chopped onion, best dinner so far. I think I'm eating
better on the road than I do at home.</p>
