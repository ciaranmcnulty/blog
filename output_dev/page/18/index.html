<p>I am now sitting under the eaves of a chalet in a Danish campsite, my tent is pitched
in front of me and I'm overlooking a pond with ducks swimming in it, the sun
has shining. I was sceptical about this campsite to start with, it was just
off the main road and there were plenty of other options further off the track
in more desirable locations, but I had done my time for the day so I risked
it.</p>

<p>There was a man standing by the gate who welcomed me and said that it cost €10
and gave me directions as to where I could pitch my tent and informed me that
the showers and other facilities were all free. I said that I had Kroner or,
€10. I flashed the note out of my walet and he said in a Danish matter-of-fact
way "That is ten euros".</p>

<p>I was glad to stop because the sun came out today which was welcome at first,
but after 3 hours I could feel myself starting to burn. I had a cap to
protect my head, but my hands were visibly going red.</p>

<p><em>Things I need to buy</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summer cycling gloves</li>
<li>Chain lubricant</li>
<li>Another tyre lever</li>
<li>More underpants</li>
</ul>

<p>The day started in the hostel, I woke up as normal at around 7am, my head
hurting somewhat. Looking in the mirror I still had large bags under my eyes.
Strange that I seem to be tired, but seemingly unable to get anymore rest than
usual. Breakfast was a buffet.</p>

<p>A man greeted me and then asked if I had my breakfast token, I searched myself
and I did not. I went back to the room and turned it over, it wasn't there. I
went back and he said not to worry about it and some other stuff that I didn't
understand. I ate a bowl of muesli, two bread rolls, two slices of cheese, I
drank a glass of orange juice and two coffees. Then I left.</p>

<p>It was a short ride to the Danish border, which I passed straight through (as
Denmark is in Schengen area). I then found myself in the town of Padborg. I
got some money (500KN, or about €67) and searched around for a supermarket (I
had very few supplies left).</p>

<p>There was the Netto discount supermarket familiar from Germany, and a new one
(sounded like "Burger") and so far these are the only two supermarkets I have
seen. I studied the exterior of the Burger market - I always prefer a
supermarket with a glass front through I which I can keep an eye on my bike
while shopping. This one reall didn't have one, but I could put in front of
the door.</p>

<p>I removed my laptop bag, detached my mobile phone, put the lock around the
wheel and went inside.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-25/IMG_20180625_120800.jpg" alt="East Sea" /></p>

<p><em>East sea</em></p>

<p>First stop, muesli - I need something for breakfast on the campsite. Then
assorted nuts for munching on the road. The nuts I found were ridiculously
expensive (40KN, about €4.50) and they were only 150g bags. There was a
cheaper packet of discount salted peanuts below them for 10KN (€1.40) which I
got. Then I got some vegetable broth (almost €4) and some dried banana flakes.
I was tempted later in the day to buy a beer, but a single can cost around
€2.50!</p>

<p>Denmark is expensive I think I've spent at least €25 on shopping today, twice
as much as in Germany.</p>

<p>I lost my way several times today so my route was not the one I expected
(following the EuroVelo 3). I took a wrong turn and was on a different cycle
route which (Ostsee weg) which ran closer to the sea (the EV3 runs more in the
middle). By the time I realised I was too far gone to turn back, so I adjusted
my plans and carried on. I can probably join back up with the EV3 tomorrow.</p>

<p>Again, the cycle path certainly added more kilometers and if I had taken the
road I would have been further north than I am now. But the path was
interesting, often going onto rough country lanes and dirt paths, running
through forests and up short, steep ascents. These sections put more content
into the day.</p>

<p><em>Pretty Forest Paths</em></p>

<p>The Danish language is only familiar to me through TV, but much of the signage
is vaguely similar to German (Bageri (DN) is Bäckerei (DE) is Bakery (EN)).
But when cashiers have told me the amount I need to pay it didn't sound
remotely like German. I will try and learn some basics while I am here if I am
able (like, for example, "thankyou").</p>

<p>The campsite is one of the cleanest campsites I have been in (especially
regarding the facilities) where the others have been in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Slept badly in the campsite last night. It was cold and my air matress seems
to have very small puncture and it deflates impartially, just enough so that
my body to intermittently come into contact with the ground when I'm turning
in my sleep. I woke at 2am, 5am and 6am, before finally waking for good at
around 7am. Again, only bread and peanut butter for breakfast with a nice cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>I used the facilities to wash my cooking equipement. For dinner I had a pack
of reheatable rice with some lentils. I cooked my dry lentils for about 10
minutes, not enough time as they didn't taste particularaly good. I think I
might get some vegetable stock and try lentil soup at some point.</p>

<p>It had rained the night before but it stopped before I left the tent and
didn't start again all day. When I left the campsite the owner looked up but
ignored me and I left, continuing on my way to my first waypoint, Neuminster.
From there I would ride to Rendsburg before making the final push to
Flensburg.</p>

<p>Rendsburg was on the other side of a large shipping canal, the Kiel Canal.
There were no bridges only the gigantic iron Rendsburg High Bridge - high
enough to let gigantic ships pass beneath it. The land is flat on either side
and trains are elevated to the bridges height by a spiral loops. It is the
longest railbridge in Europe.</p>

<p>Realising that there was no possiblity of crossing the railbridge I wondred
how I would cross. The cycle route indicated that I could cross <em>under</em> the
railway bridge, presumably by ferry. When I got to the crossing it was closed
for maintainence, or just closed, I'm not sure. Interestingly it wasn't ferry
but a transporter bridge, where a section of road is suspended from the
railway bridge above and moved back and forth. Before I turned off to the
defunct transporter bridge I thought I heard another cycling shout at me "...
.. nicht mehr" (something, something, no more). I looked back and his gaze
wasn't directed at me so I ignored it.</p>

<p>I stood in front of the railway bridge and said "Well, how the fuck am I
supposed to get across now?" then the other cyclists (an old man and his wife)
caught up with me, he was beaming and said that there is a crossing 1km down
the river, I said "Is there a bridge?" in German, but the old man looked
confused and turned to his wife "Did you understand what he said?", yep, my
German still sucks.</p>

<p>It was a ferry crossing and it was 2km down the canal. It didn't cost anything
and I made my way to the town center and found a bakery.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-24/IMG_20180624_122228.jpg" alt="Canal" /></p>

<p><em>The ferry crossing</em></p>

<p>The bakery didn't have any savoury food left (and I was all out of bread and
backed beans). I got a coffee and an apple cake. I decided to book my hostel
for the night.</p>

<p>I decided to stay in a hostel, as there were no less than 3 in Flensburg,
inclduing a hostelling international one, which was full. The other was not
and I booked (again I used my German, but again the guy didn't have a clue
what I was saying).</p>

<p>There is a cycle route (marked on <em>my</em> map as <code>OM</code>) which tracks my route and
takes me all the way to the top of Denmark, it is not direct however, and I
can often find cycle paths on direct roads and avoid it altogether. Sometimes
I find my self on it however, and today it yielded a surprise.</p>

<p><em>Gottorf Castle</em></p>

<p>The region I was cycling through was Schleswig-Holstien, and I was in the
eponymous town Schleswig. Following my GPS I found myself driving through the
huge gates of a manor, a gigantic, magestic, white building. The path skirted
around the side and then I found myself riding through the gardens where there
were numerous sculptures and water features and it made me wonder if I should
stick to the cycle route more often, but time and my stamina is limited.</p>

<p>Whilst the last few days had been flat, this part of the route became
undulating. The most hilly it has been since day one.</p>

<p><em>Typical road-side cycle path</em></p>

<p>I arrived in Flensburg (home of the Flensburger beer, a national favourite)
and the closest town to the Danish border (which is just 7km away). I found
the hostel and booked in - it was more expensive that I had thought, but I
piad for breakfast and the room and it cost €28. The girl at reception let me
put the bike in the room ("My boss doesn't like it, but as long as it's
clean). I am currently the only person in the 4 bed room.</p>

<p>"n another campsite and there is loud "Oktoberfest" music playing from
somewhere in vicinity. It's damp, and I'm sitting in a lean-to sheltered
from the spitting rain. I seem to be on a regular bike-touring path as there
is a old cycling dutch couple on the pitch next to mine, and a french couple
on the opposite side. The weather is supposed to be improved on Tuesday.</p>

<p>I woke this morning in my tent in Zeven at around 5am, then dozed until about
7am and planned my breakfast, I didn't have much, just some bread, peanut
butter and coffee. I packed my stuff up and left the camp ground. I wanted to
use their WIFI to download the map, but it was €5 euro for an hour, or €10 for
a day, so I didn't do that. Fortunately the map I needed was quite small
(161mb) so I downloaded it on my phones 3G.</p>

<p>I was heading to Hamburg, but I decided to plan a bit further ahead and got
some google directions to the Danish border (~300km away). Surprisingly it did
not suggest going through Hamburg, and the two routes it gave me seemed less
than optimal, one of them did however go over the river Elbe. The problem with
the route is that Hamburg is slightly out of the way due to the river cutting
so far into the land, the google directions showed that there was a ferry
crossing. I could avoid Hamburg altogether and save both time and 20km of
distance. But my first stop was to be Buxtehude and I decided to delay my
decision until then.</p>

<p>I managed to stay on a minor road which cut a pretty straight line to
Buxtehude and as usual had a good cycle path.</p>

<p>My starting point on this tour was Bielefeld, famously known in Germany as the
"Town that does not exist" - a rumour started in a usenet group on the
internet in the 90s. Chancellor Angela Merkel even alluded to it once after
giving a speech there ".. if it exists at all ... ", "I had the impression I
was there...".</p>

<p>Buxtehude has a similar association, it is known as the "Fairytale capital of
the world" due to a Brothers Grimm fairy tale being set there, and therefore
it is sometimes claimed that it "doesn't exist".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-23/IMG_20180623_123316.jpg" alt="Airbus" /></p>

<p><em>Brand new jet</em></p>

<p>I stopped in the town for a cake and a coffee, there was a school band (or at
least a group of children) playing songs such as "Greensleeves", it was very
busy. I checked my map and planned my route. I was in the center which is
already 2 past the road I wanted to be on to Hamburg, and there was a ferry
crossing immediately north, so I would try the ferry.</p>

<p>I cycled on a road which ran adjacent to a canal and soon I was close the
ferry port. I rode over a bridge, and only realised 2km later, that the ferry
was supposed to be at the bridge I passed, but I could see no signs there,
I didn't want to go back and there was another crossing further down. So I
continued.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-23/IMG_20180623_125352.jpg" alt="View from the ferry" /></p>

<p>Another feature of Buxtehude is that it houses a division of Airbus (the
airplane manufacturer). I encountered their huge facility on the ride to the
ferry and rode around it. I could see brand new jets as if they had just been
unpacked, almost as if they were wrapped in cling-film.</p>

<p>The ferry port was in the town/village of Finkenweder. I asked a lady on a
bicycle where the ferry was she looked non-plussed and gave me directions.</p>

<p>At the ferry port I searched and found the ferry and rode down to it, the
ferry was there and gangway was down, but it was beeping, it was saying
"Stand back" - it was about to close, I hesitated and then rode straight into
the boat over the imminently closing platform amid some gasps from the
passengers (I didn't know how often they ran so didn't want to miss it).</p>

<p>The ferry was part of the public transport system, and there was a ticket
machine board, I payed €1.60 for the multi-stop crossing and got off at the
first stop on the other side where I sat down and had a can of baked beans and
the small piece of remaining bread from breakfast.</p>

<p>Following the marked route on my map I travelled down the promenade until
there was a beach and to my right a path that said "No Cycling". Hmm. What to
do, I didn't want to go back. The main road was above me and could be accessed
by the path and about 4 flights of stairs. I decided to carry my bike up the
stairs, the bike is heavy, but I find if I grip the frame under the chain I
can carry it up stairs without breaking my back.</p>

<p>For the next hour I threaded my way through dreary suburbia, networks of
small roads having constantly to refer to my GPS in order to reach the main
road and resume my journey.</p>

<p>Having downloaded the map in the morning, I had a good overview of where
campsites and hostels could be located. The road went pretty much straight
north and the first potential stop was Bad-Bremsteht, the next was Neuminster
a further 18km, but the campsite was out of the way.</p>

<p>With some luck I should be able to get to Flensburg tomorrow, which is near
the border to Denmark, and depending on accommodation options, possibly pass
over to Denmark.</p>
