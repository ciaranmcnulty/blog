            <p>The sun was shining when I crawled out of my tent and was greeted with an
amazing view over the fjord. Clouds were dripping off one of the further
cliffs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_090418.jpg" alt="Leaving the campsite" /></p>

<p><em>Leaving the campsite</em></p>

<p>Today I would get a ferry and make prgress northwards, to Førde or Naustdal.</p>

<p>I rode the 13km to the ferry, and as I rode along side the fjord I could see
the ferry slowly making its way over, and with a kilometer to go I knew I
would catch it.</p>

<p>As I rode into the ferry dock there were two camper vans and their inhabitants
were standing around waiting. They gave me a smile and a wave and I nodded
back "hallo". I stood and watched the ferry approach, it's front drive-on
platform opening like a mouth to consume the dock.</p>

<p>I waited for a mother and her children and a single car to depart the ferry
and started to wheel my bike on, the ferry man said something to me
"Krachella?" I said I didn't understand and if he spoke English, he didn't
very well. "Where you go?" I pointed to where the ferry had come from.</p>

<p>It turned out that this Sunday ferry service wasn't retuning to my destaintion
(Rysjedalsvika) until midday - another two and half-hours. I started wondering
what I could do until then - there were no other options. I scouted out the
waiting room, and noticed a plug socket. At least I could sit down and work
for that time.</p>

<p>As I walked around to fetch my bike one of the campers walked towards me
"Sprechen sie Deustch? English?". It turned out that the campers had made the
same assumption as me, but their motorized transport gave them another option,
to drive 25km down the coast and get a different ferry. They offered to take
me along. We put my bike and myself into one of the vans and drove off.</p>

<p>They were two couples from Switzerland and had driven from Bern and were just
freely floating north, with no particular plans. They all seemed like really
nice laid-back people. They were determined today to do as little driving as
possible and go for a walk, or go fishing. We crossed in the ferry, it cost
150kr for the camper van and three people.</p>

<p>It was 9:30 when I arrived at the first ferry port, and it was 11:00 when I
arrived on the other island. At this point I had only 15km on my
cycle-computer, not that it could be helped, but not an ideal number this late
in the day, but the lift saved me an hour and a half and I got to meet some
great people.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_121444.jpg" alt="More water" /></p>

<p><em>Water, water and more water</em></p>

<p>I was now at Lavik, about 15km from the original ferry port, but there was a
road which cut up through the terrain and eventually rejoined my route. My
route diverged from the cycle route by cutting straight over the land instead
of skirting around and getting another ferry. It was faster, but I'm sure I
missed some nice sights, and it would be very steep.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_151815.jpg" alt="Bridge by the tunnels" /></p>

<p><em>In between tunnels</em></p>

<p>My route led me to the town of Dale, where the main road disapeared into
non-cyclable tunnels, but an alternate pedestrian/cycle route was provided
which was probably an old road, and had it's own tunnels. Cycling down these
tunnels was quiet eerie, as they felt abandoned somehow (but they had lights).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_145916.jpg" alt="Heading towards Dale" /></p>

<p><em>Heading towards Dale</em></p>

<p>Exiting the tunnels I was riding the side of the mountain with the fjord at my
left, the opposite side seemed like a sheer wall of rock, and there was a
multi-streamed waterfall pouring white into the water.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_152040.jpg" alt="Waterfall" /></p>

<p><em>The waterfall, I need a new camera</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-08/IMG_20180708_152615.jpg" alt="After the fall" /></p>

<p><em>After the 'fall</em></p>

<p>The last stretch from Dale to Førde led eventually up to a 400m high plateau -
I only knew it was a plateau in retrospect, and after making the initial climb
(slightly painful due to saddle sore) I was unsure if I would have to do
another climb before the end of the day, but it was plain sailing on even
ground before a long descent from 380m to Førde. I took the E39 main road for
the last part, which was a bit unsettling due to the amount of traffic and
small hard-shoulder.</p>

<p>It was raining when I arrived at the campsite, and still is. I've eaten most
of my food now. It's Sunday, so no supermarkets were open. I have nothing
substantial to eat for breakfast, and my camping gas is running very low - so
will try and do shopping tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fortunately this campsite includes Wifi in the price - and even the shower,
which has cost 10kr per 5 minutes in all other campsites.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I got out of bed at the hostel at around 7am and went to the kitchen to make
some coffee, I decided not to have breakfast as I wanted to leave early, so I
just used some of my Muesli and one of the hostel people put the coffee on.</p>

<p>I sat down and was joined by Katrina from the "team" and then by a new
Spanish arrival who was studying in Trondheim and had gotten the plane to
Bergen for the weekend.</p>

<p>I had decided to go east and head directly to Oslo. The cycle path ended
shortly after turning west, and resumed about 15km east. Zooming in I could
see there was a train line going that way, so it would seem that this section
of road was not suitable for bikes (probably a long tunnel) and I would need
to get the train.</p>

<p>I left the hostel a bit later than anticipated and decided to head to the
Tourist Information center to get some more information, but when I got there
it was up a flight of stairs, and I didn't want to leave my bike out-of-sight,
so I just left.</p>

<p>Up until a certain point I could still change my mind about turning east, and
that point was about 15km from the hostel. As I cycled towards it I knew I was
deferring my final decision, and when I got there I stopped and debated with
myself for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>My original plan was to cycle to Trondheim. I was now running out of time, so
it would be impossible to cycle to Trondheim and back and still be back at
work on the date required. But there were other options, I could get the night
train from Trondheim to Oslo, but even with that I would have only 6 or so
days to cycle down Sweden - but then of I assume I could get the train again,
or a bus.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-07/IMG_20180707_180830.jpg" alt="Tunnel" /></p>

<p><em>Tunnel</em></p>

<p>I imagined the negativity I would express when people asked me about my trip
"Yeah, I had meant to cycle to Trondheim, but I ran out of time, so I came
back". If I turned east, I would have effectively <em>failed my mission</em>! While
getting the train from Trondheim was always a contingency.</p>

<p>I continued north. I have money to get back, and I may never do this again.</p>

<p>In the hostel I spoke to an English guy who had just cycled from Trondheim,
and it took him 10 days, doing around 70k a day, so I could probably do it in
a week.</p>

<p>The route today took me across some suspension bridges and I got a ferry from
Liervag to Slovag, which cost 40kr and took around 20 minutes or less. I
napped on the ferry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-07/IMG_20180707_111528.jpg" alt="Suspension Bridge" /></p>

<p><em>Suspension Bridge</em></p>

<p>There is not an abundance of campsites on this route, and I had a choice
between cycling 140km and having another ferry crossing (which could
potentially involve an hour wait) or another campsite which was on average
15km off-route, but was in total a slightly shorter distance to ride today,
and a sure-thing.</p>

<p>I already had 7.5 hours and 100 under my belt at this point, and I turned
off the cycle path to the campsite. The new route went east around a lake. As
I rode down it I was impressed by the large mountains rising up around the
lake. After 10km I got to the village of Ausgulen. The mountains closed in
around it, and the road went into the mountains. On the other side was the
fjord.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-07/IMG_20180707_183622.jpg" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>The Lake</em></p>

<p>I didn't realise it was a mountain pass until I rode up the first section and
looked up - I could a road 100m above me, and I hoped it wasn't my road, but
it was. So I climbed and turned and climbed and turned.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-07/IMG_20180707_193823.jpg" alt="Looking down into the valley" /></p>

<p><em>Looking back from the pass</em></p>

<p>The view was magnificent looking back down to the lake, the top of the pass
was sooner than I anticipated, and I could see the water of the fjord and I
rode straight down to it, and found my way to this campsite.</p>

<p>As I erected my tent I heard the dreaded <em>snap</em>! again, the tent pole had
broken. It had broken in a different place. I made an exclamation and my
neighbor came over to see what the matter was. I said "My tent pole has
broken", he offered me some duck-tape, but then reconsidering said "wait a
minute", I knew then what he had in mind and he rummaged through his tent case
and pulled out an emergency pole repair segment I was hoping for (the same
thing I had used to fix my pole the first time).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-07/IMG_20180707_221118.jpg" alt="View from the campsite" /></p>

<p><em>View from the campsite</em></p>

<p>I was very lucky to have this man camping next to me - I'm not sure I could
have sufficiently repaired the tent to make it useful otherwise.</p>

<p>I am now sitting in the campsite kitchen, having just cooked (they have
hotplates in here, so I can save my camping gas). I am charging my phone from
my laptop (saving my portable power-pack) and would like to be using their
internet too - but it would seem to require payment, so I may need to use some
of my mobile data allowance on my phone to upload this blog post.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I burnt through 90% of it in the first week, so now I only have
around 100MB left and then nothing until I get back to Germany. So have to
ration it very carefully. Hence, no photos today, will add them
retrospectively.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>It was waffle night in the hostel. It's a hostel run for 3 summer months by
students from a certain University in Chicago, there are 7 of them here and
they form a "team". During the rest of the year the facility is used for
something else. It's very sociable and friendly.</p>

<p>I have decided to cycle east to Oslo - I am potentially missing some very nice
mountains to the north, but it's half-time and I need to turn back. The
eastern route looks good, and there are 2 cycle paths which I could take, and
one claims to be "downhill all the way to Oslo", there seem to be plenty of
campsites on the road.</p>

<p>I slept badly last night. All of the beds were in a single room, and placed
relatively close together, and the not-so-solid iron beds were stuck against
each other, meaning that my neighbour turning or raising himself up in bed
would cause mine to rock, and same for the person underneath me. This is a
constant irritation with some hostels, and it's always better to have solid
immovable bunks. Then there was the snoring and the small blanket we were
given. I'm normally sleep fine in hostels, but last night not so much.</p>

<p>I woke up at 7am and tried to make coffee, but I couldn't find an Italian
Coffee Maker (mine was locked up with my bike), and I didn't really want to
deplete my coffee in the filter coffee machine. Fortunately I met Colin, who
was starting his second day working at the hostel. He offered to put the
coffee machine on and we had a chat. I mentioned that I would run up one of
the mountains today, and he said that he'd like to come along, so we would run
up the biggest of the seven mountains the city is famed for: Ulriken.</p>

<p>I had breakfast: Boiled eggs, jam sandwich, cheese and a yoghurt. All costing
only €3, exceptionally cheap for Norway. I had to Google "How to boil an egg".
I then worked on my open-source programming project for an hour before we left
to run the mountain.</p>

<p><em>View from the TV tower</em></p>

<p>We ran in the direction of the ski lift and found the trail around 20 minutes
from the hostel. We started to run up, Colin taking the lead and he was faster
than me and would often pause and wait for me to catch up. I started well, but
after 25 minutes started to slow down. The trail was very rocky and technical,
at the bottom we ran over loose rocks and tree roots, and these gave way more
to larger rocks until the trees disappeared and we made the final ascent. I
scrambled on all fours up the rock faces and we made it to the top.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-06/IMG_20180706_123231.jpg" alt="Colin and I at the TV Tower" /></p>

<p><em>Colin and I at the TV Tower</em></p>

<p>There was a TV tower and lots of hikers and the view was good. Colin said
"Shall we run to that one, it's not very far" he pointed. I said "err, why
not?". We ran down and then started up again, the peak was Ulriken and was
680m - not that high, but we started from sea-level.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-06/IMG_20180706_124247.jpg" alt="Colin by the Cairn at the top of Ulriken" /></p>

<p><em>Colin by the Cairn at the top of Ulriken</em></p>

<p>The way down was fun, if not very fast, as care was required not to slip and
fall over. In total I think we ran for about an hour and forty-five minutes.</p>
