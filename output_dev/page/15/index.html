<p>Woke up in the campsite after a pretty good nights sleep, made the usual
breakfast - the coffee is very important. I don't feel human without it.</p>

<p>I packed my stuff up, filled my water bottles. I saw William (the American
cyclist I spoke to the night before) preparing to leave and I went to pay. "Do
you want a coffee?" asked the campsite manager, I thought about it, and
refused "I just brushed my teeth, it wouldn't taste so good", I waited around
for a few minutes checking my route. I half-expected to cycle to the ferry
crossing to Bergen with William, who was going to an adjacent island instead
of Bergen, but after a few minutes I left and went on my own.</p>

<p>It was spitting with rain when I left, and most of the morning it spat and
drizzled, but didn't quite turn into rain. I didn't listen to any music today
or do any lessons. It was mostly quiet and I was happy in my own thoughts.</p>

<p>At some points in the route the cycle-route signage has been ambiguous and
sometimes it doesn't exist, and sometimes it doesn't exist at points where it
really would be greatly beneficial if it did exist. This is how I ended up in
a dead-end fishing village at the bottom of a hill 2.2km from my route.</p>

<p>I made it to the ferry crossing to Bergen and Husavik at around lunch time. It
was a bigger affair than the previous crossing and there was a toll booth, but
also a cycle way which I followed without paying - in the waiting area I asked
some waiting passengers if it's expected to pay on the ferry, and they said it
was.</p>

<p>Outside of the waiting area I saw a touring bicycle leaning against a building
on it's own. I didn't get a good look at William's bike, but I think from the
description he gave me, this was it. I didn't seem him before I boarded the
ferry to Bergen however.</p>

<p>The ferry crossing cost around €7.50 and didn't take very long.</p>

<p><em>Approaching Land</em></p>

<p>After leaving the ferry I was on the look out for a place to eat lunch (a
bench) but after an hour I just decided to stop at the next convenient rock. I
had a couple of baps with Laughing Cow cheese triangles and exotic fruit mix,
then thought about where I would stay tonight.</p>

<p>Bergen is under my target 100km for the day, but looking past Bergen, I
couldn't see a campsite within a reasonable distance, so it would make sense
to stay in a hostel in the city. There was a YMCA hostel, I emailed them as
they didn't have the country code for their telephone number, another hostel
did, so I phoned them and they said they had space "Can I make a reservation?"
"Yeah, sure ... well, here's the thing - it's my first day here and I don't
know how to make a booking, but we have 4 beds free so if you just turn up it
will be fine".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-05/IMG_20180705_100010.jpg" alt="Reflection" /></p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>The route to Bergen took me over a 260m mountain-hill. Not high enough to be a
mountain, but you wouldn't know the difference when riding up it. From there
it was mostly a descent through the suburbs of Bergen.</p>

<p>"Berg" means "mountain" appropriately, although the city was originally called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen">Bjørgvin</a> . The cycle path was amazing,
as soon as I got into the city limits there were frequent cyclists on racing
cycles and mountain bikes (of all ages), and lots of runners too. The cycle
path threaded over and under roads and I only remember hitting a single
traffic light while going to the city center.</p>

<p>The suburbs seem to have grown over the mountains, with roads bridging streams
and houses built upon rocks and tunnels everywhere.</p>

<p>I soon found my way to the hostel and was welcomed. It seems to be a very nice
hostel run by travellers. In the common room them is a guitar and piano (as I
walked in there was a young guy playing guitar and singing lazily). Tonight is
waffle night apparently. Smoking and Alcohol are forbidden.</p>

<p>Bergen is also a good place for hiking, it's known as the "City of Seven
Mountains" and some, if not all, are accessible from the center, so I am
thinking about staying another night and running up one.</p>

<p>The woman came around at around 9pm to collect my payment for the camping. We
went into the previously-closed reception area and I paid about €15 with my
card and I asked if there was anywhere I could sit down and do some work on my
laptop. The reception was connected with a largish common room, but it was not
being used for that purpose currently, but she showed me some outdoor plugs
and where I could sit down under the eaves of the building.</p>

<p>I remarked on how quiet it was, and she said it was because all of the campers
/ residents were on holiday (Croatia, Spain), and that they were all
Norwegian. I said I worked in Berlin and she asked if I spoke German, I said a
little, and then she lamented how many Germans come to the campsite and cannot
speak any English, and that she just got back from Spain, and few Spanish
people speak English. When I said I was from Berlin, she asked if I was at
university there, good to know I still pass for a student at 37.</p>

<p>Every Norwegian I have spoken to (and every dutch person for that matter) were
able to speak fluent English. To the extent that I rarely use my prase
"Forstår du engelsk?".</p>

<p>When I woke up it was to a fresh, damp and cloudy morning and I wondered if
the weather would turn (I haven't checked the weather reports). I left and
resumed the number 1 cycle route.</p>

<p>My rear mud guard had been rubbing intermittently against my tyre for the past
week, and had recently become an almost constant irritation, and every time I
tried to locate the problem I could not. This morning I saw it, it was the
one of bungee cords holding the tent on the back of my bike, it was threaded
in such a way that it was pushing against the mud guard. Fixing this my bike
was again running silent, which is always reassuring.</p>

<p><em>Another picture of the road</em></p>

<p>I used my gloves and hat, although it was not so cold as to require me to
change the rest of my gear. The hat has the added benefit of shielding my ear
phones (when I wear them) from the wind. The wind is amplified with earphones
in, and up to a certain point you can only turn the music up, but the ringing
in my ears is a constant reminder not to do that anymore.</p>

<p><em>Land</em></p>

<p>I did two more Norwegian lessons, and can now count to thirteen: et, to, tre
(tree), fire (fear-a), fem, sex, sju (shoo), åtte (ott-a), ni (nee), ti (tee), tolv,
tretten.</p>

<p>The first stop was the town of Haugesund. I found a bakery (the first I have
used in Norway, there don't seem to be many of them - it's mostly
supermarkets) and got a sort-of cinnamon pastry with a splodge of vanilla in
the center. I considered getting a coffee and sitting down, but then the cost
would have been about €8, so I passed and found a bench in the center.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-04/IMG_20180704_104646.jpg" alt="Haugesund" /></p>

<p><em>Haguesund</em></p>

<p>The second stop was the single ferry crossing of the day. I hadn't done any
research, and when I got there, there were no cars or people. There was a
toilet (with a shower) and some benches. I looked at the timetable but
couldn't make any sense of it. I researched on the internet and found the
correct time table and it ran every hour. Soon a few cars turned up. I sat
down and had my lunch and eventually watched the car-ferry pull in to the dock.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-04/IMG_20180704_132436.jpg" alt="Ferry" /></p>

<p><em>Ferry</em></p>

<p>On board, a man came around and collected the fare, which was 40kr (about €4),
and it took 30m to cross.</p>

<p>There were no major climbs today, but there was a fair amount of up and down
and the now familiar landscape (although more rocky and less mountainous).</p>

<p>There was another two crossings, but these were done by suspension bridges (each a
kilometer long).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-04/IMG_20180704_164640.jpg" alt="Suspension Bridge Number Two" /></p>

<p><em>The Second Suspension Bridge</em></p>

<p>I saw a fair amount of people painting their characteristic Norwegian
white-planked houses, and noticed the pealing paint on a number of others, I
guess that this is a yearly chore. Apparently the houses are made of wood
<a href="http://mylittlenorway.com/2009/05/norwegian-houses/">because of the weather</a>
and it even costs more to insure a brick house.</p>

<p>In the evening while I was sitting by my solitary tent in the campsite a man
approached me, he introduced himself as William and said that he was cycling
north. He was from the US but lived in Germany and was on a shorter trip than
me having driven up to Hirtshals and taking the ferry with his bike, he was
heading to the city of Bergen (the next stop for me, I may have heard him
incorrectly) where he will get the ferry back to Hirtshals in order that he
can go back to work on Monday.</p>

<p>He informed me that the terrain will get significantly steeper after Bergen,
with some mountains being 700 - 800m. This corresponded with information I had
earlier from a young woman from Bodensee (Germany) who is on holiday here
with her family. She said that I would see glaciers as I headed north.</p>

<p>I took a rest day at the hostel in Stavanger, it was a nice hostel, the staff
were friendly and helpful.</p>

<p>I tried to maintain my bike, attempting to first fix my gears (I think I made
them worse overall, but at least now I have a better understanding of how to
adjust them) and I tried to fix my sinking handlebar bag, but ended up
tightening it too much and breaking off one of the bolts - there were 3 bolts
and one of them is now rounded and stuck, the other broke off, and another one
is fastened far too tightly but is the only one holding the whole thing on
now, and I'm too scared to loosen it up and adjust it properly. Hopefully it
will hold out (I should have dissembled the whole thing to start with).</p>

<p>I did some shopping, and got some chain lubricant, a cap (in anticipation of a
temperature drop) and some summer cycling gloves and checked the ferry port to
see where I could go from here, the cycling route was not specific on how I
should continue - the route I was following went to an island and then
abruptly stopped then continued on another island, but there was no ferry to
that island. I could however get the ferry to Nedstrand and the cycle west to
rejoin my route.</p>

<p>I recognised a cyclist waiting outside the ferry station - I had actually seen
him several times of the past few days. I first encountered him at the
Bibelcamp camp site. The alarm went off in the toilet block and he walked out
of the shower and looked at me enquiringly wondering what was going on. I
shrugged and carried on. Then the next day I passed him while he was having
lunch, and again when I was cycling back to the campsite I had passed (on my
11 hour day).</p>

<p>I approached him and said "hello", he seemed non-plussed and I'm not sure he
recognised me, and then his friend came over, who I also recognised from the
campsite. We chatted for a while and then I left them (I was running at the
time), they are on the same route as me, so I may well see them again.</p>

<p>There were two possible crossing times, one at 7:30am, with a single change,
and the other at 15:30. I was reluctant to leave the hostel and dive back into
the cycling/camping routine, and considered staying another day, but I figured
if I took the 15:30 then I would have most of the day at the hostel with no
extra cost and still make some headway to continue the next day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-03/IMG_20180703_172138.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p><em>Life across the water</em></p>

<p>When I left the hostel and got my ticket at the station, I saw two more
bicycles, and then the cyclists and they sounded distinctly English, I said
hello, they were from Scotland and had just got in from England to Stavanger,
so it was there first day I think.</p>

<p>The crossing took about an hour, after getting off I had another chat with the
cycling couple from Scotland and then headed off, then realized that I had no
Norwegian cash, then that I had no euros, and then that there was no cash
machine in this village.</p>

<p>I tried the next village, and asked a clerk in the village shop, he said I
could get money at the counter, so we tried my German bank card "service not
available", well then surely the VISA would work "service not available" as a
last attempt I tried my remaining card, and same result. He said that the next
cash machine was 35 away, which was fine and the campsites probably take
card anyway.</p>

<p>I rode for an hour and found the first campsite, but it didn't look very
appealing and I couldn't find the reception anyway, the second one was only
another 10km on. The road was actually fairly flat and I made good time.</p>

<p>Cycling into my current campsite a woman was mowing the lawn and looked at me
welcomingly and I asked if this was the camping, she said yes and told me
where to put my tent, and when I asked her if she took card she said "yes".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-03/IMG_20180703_183748.jpg" alt="Campsite" /></p>

<p><em>Current Campsite</em></p>

<p>I've just had my dinner and I've tried a variation on my lentil soup recipe.
I've had a whole container of dried beans with me all of this time, whilst
getting through two bags of lentils.</p>

<p>Last night I put a bunch of beans (black and red) in a container and let them
soak for about 12 hours. I cooked them with lentils, vegetable broth, bean
broth (the water the beans were soaking in), added pasta after 10 minutes and
finished off by adding a dollop of pesto and a sprinkling of Tabasco. Served
with a loaf bread from which I cut rough pieces and soaked in the soup.</p>

<p>Doesn't taste bad, not good either, but full of proteins and energy for
cycling.</p>

<p>Dried beans are great food to have when cycling as they take up little space.
The only trick is remembering to soak them (pretty sure you can cook them dry
as well, but it would take at least an hour of camping gas usage).</p>
