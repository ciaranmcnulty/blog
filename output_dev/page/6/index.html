        <div>
            <p>Slept perfectly in the airy and cheap room. I really liked the old hotel, it
had very tall ceilings and there was lots of space. It was run down and old,
but very clean, and the family that were running it were incredibly welcoming.</p>

<p>My German has come in very useful so far, but in this town, Bartosxyce, it
seems that it's not as useful, so far nobody has been able to converse with me
in either English or German.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/1.JPG" alt="Riding by a beach" /></p>

<p><em>Riding past empty beach</em></p>

<p>I had a good breakfast in the hotel, cheese, cucumber, tomato and egg. I
couldn't finish it all. I got my bike and my stuff and said thankyou to the
staff and rode out of the town. I made my way north to the coast, trying to
pick up the EV10 again. There were cycle paths, of that took me directly along
the coast, to the town of Tolkmicko, from here there was no marked cycle
route, but I decided to follow the green dotted line on my map anyway - this
started off as a forest road (on which I missed more than one turning) which
eventually opened out in to a meadow, before hitting the road and leading on
to Frombork.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/2.JPG" alt="Forst Path" /></p>

<p><em>Ride the forest</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/3.JPG" alt="and the meadows" /></p>

<p><em>...and the meadows</em></p>

<p>On the way I heard another KLUNK! This time it was the sound of my bottom
bottle-cage falling into my front sprocket. I turned around and my drink
bottle and the undone screw were just lying in the mud 10m behind me, so not a
big disaster, not like, for example, something going wrong when driving a car
up a mountain in Albania.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/4.JPG" alt="Fellen out thing" /></p>

<p><em>When things become lose and fall out but it's fine because you found the bit
and it wouldn't have mattered much anyway to be honest with you</em></p>

<p>Frombork (Frauenberg in German) is mainly famous because it is where Nicholas
Copernicus mad his astromomical observations and wrote the book in which he
wrote that the sun revolves around the earth (or was it the earth around the
sun? anyway, who cares) - and he did this all while admistering this region as
Bishop (I think), and even having to deal with the pesky Teutonic Knights, who
radied and eventually sacked the town (but Corpernicus had already left ahead
of the event).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/5.JPG" alt="Copernicus" /></p>

<p><em>Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint
Andrew (ABABVMSA for short), statue of Corpernicus in foreground</em></p>

<p>Interestingly a month or two back I was reading the book (never finished) "A
More Perfect Heaven" by Dava Sobel, which is a popular history of Copernicus,
and descibes this town, region and political climate in some detail, and I
remember not really knowing where it was geographically, and today I stumbled
upon it by chance.</p>

<p>I stopped here for a coffee then continued, I had to dive down to Pieniężo,
there seemed to be a road reconstruction project happening, and I had to ride
through at least 4 1 road one-way road works - the traffic lights would stay
red for I would guess 10 minutes, but after not waiting for the first one to
go green, I just rode through the red lights, there was rarely any traffic,
and it's easy to move a bicycle out of the way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/6.JPG" alt="Bird 1" /></p>

<p><em>Nobody knows what these birds are</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/7.JPG" alt="Bird 2" /></p>

<p><em>They occupy poles</em></p>

<p>I had lunch in front of a statue of the pope (not the first I've seen, he's
standing there with his staff giving a benediction) and on the way out of
the town I was confused by a sign which seemed to indicate the road was closed
and there was diversion, but cars kept going down it, one of the cars, seeing
my confusion, stopped and asked me "can I help?" (I guess), he didn't speak
English but I pointed down the road and said "Dobje?" and pointed to my bike,
he said yes, until Gorowo at least - or he asked "you go to Gorowo" and I said
yes, anyway - the important thing is that I didn't know that going <em>further</em>
than Gorowo was possible.</p>

<p>I intended to stay in Gorowo, but when I arrived it definitely didn't seem as
prosperous as the previous towns, and I could find no hotels, and although
there was a campsite on the map, when I went to it there was no sign of one
existing. I had done 110k by this point and now I had to go to the next town
which, judging by my map, had at least 5 hotels (but no campsites), I
very optimistically judged it as 10km, but the sign reported 21km, and then
there was a diversion, the diversion sign was specifically saying that using
the main road to go to Bartosxyce (the next town) was not possible, and that
you needed to follow a 10km diversion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-06/8.JPG" alt="Napolean" /></p>

<p><em>Somebody dedicated this bench to Napolean Bonaparte - he fought an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Eylau">inconclusive</a> battle here
abouts</em></p>

<p>I didn't want to risk going down a route which is reported as being closed -
with a bike you can <em>usually</em> bypass road works, but just walking or riding
around them, for example, on the pavement, but it's not always the case --
once I cycled 10km down a closed road only to get to a bridge which had been
demolished - I had to cycle all the way back, otherwise it could mean that the
whole road was dug up. I decided not to risk it and took the diversion.</p>

<p>I finally rolled into Bartosxyce at around 7pm and checked into the first
hotel. This was a mistake. I pushed open the door, and had to leave my bicycle
downstairs (which I always dislike, but at least I locked it), upstairs I
found the landlady, and it was quickly apparent that she spoke only Polish, I
had to use my phone to translate the most basic "I want to stay for one night
and I have a bicycle". She was mostly humorless, and when she first clapped
eyes on me she didn't look very welcoming (to be fair I was very dirty from
riding through sand and mud and rain all day). The hotel cost 120 Zsloty (€29)
and didn't include breakfast, the room has an air extraction unit buzzing away
continuously and there is a faint and funny smell. If I were a reviewing
person, I don't think this would be a glowing report.</p>

<p>They didn't take cash, so I had to use most of my Zsloty's. It is around 160km
to Lithuania from here, so I expect to be in Poland one more night.</p>

<p>For Lunch I found a Pizzeria, they didn't have my usual Vegetariana, but they
had some extermely spicy pizza, I ordered the "big" pizza, assuming it would
be a "normal" big pizza, but apparently 50cm is bigger than I expected, so I
just ate a good deal of Pizza.</p>

<p>I think I found out why my gears were slipping - I had just cycled through
very much wet sand when they got worse, at one of the many traffic lights I
jumped off and inspected the sprockets which carry the chain from the
wheel-sprocket, they were caked in sludge. I peddaled and ran my finger
against them and reams of sludge flew off, I repeated this on both of them.
This impoved the gears, but I think there is also more sludge on the gear
cables under the seat-post pole, I think once I clear that the gears will be
as good as new.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2019/07/05/gdansk-elblag/">Gdansk to Elbląg</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Woke up in the dormitory this morning with a heavy head, we had consumed a
fair amount of vodka the previous night. I expected to meet people in the
hostel, as you almost always do. The first guy was Xavier, originally from
Peurto Rico, but who has been a digital nomad for the past 7 years (and only
29 years old), the young Australian couple, Nikki and Ash, had spent the past
3 months in Canada and visited Mexico, before dropping in to Poland to visit
relatives, and then a Swede who had just purchased a boat and came over to
Gdansk as he was considering sailing from Stockholm. There were three other
young Swedes who were clearly there to get completely trashed, but all were
friendly and it was good meet all of them.</p>

<p>So with a heavy head I climbed out of bed at around 7:30, the breakfast buffer
was down in the basement where we had spent the previous evening, I didn't
expect to see any of my colleagues from the previous night, as they probably
got back at 6am, or perhaps were still partying. The buffer was quite simple,
some cheese and meat slices, cucumbers, tomatoes and cereal and milk.</p>

<p>I didn't manage to upload the days blog post the night before, so I finished
it off and uploaded it on the savagely slow internet connection. I could have
used my faster mobile connection, but am reluctant to abuse that as I don't
know how long it will last outside of Germany.</p>

<p>Still I was undecided if I was going to leave or not - Gdansk clearly had a
lot to offer, and I could pass the day running, walking and working, and maybe
play the piano, but at the same time I wanted to press on and save my rest
days for later, although I'm fairly sure I can make it to Helsinki and back in
one month, I don't know how many free days I will have.</p>

<p>Getting out of Gdansk was done by trial and error. The main road running out
of the city was at least not cycle friendly, if cycles were not forbidden, so
I chose minor roads, but it seemed each road I took would lead to a dead end,
or at one point an industrial lorry checkpoint, eventually I found myself on a
clealy signed cycle path (all of EuroVelo routes 9, 10 and 13).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/1.JPG" alt="Eurovelo" /></p>

<p><em>EV 9,10,13</em></p>

<p>I discovered that EV 10 would take me to my milestone today, Elbląg, so I
followed that. It took me to a river crossing, I was unsure if it was worth
crossing the river or riding upstream and crossing the bridge -- if I crossed
the bridge I would still need to cycle around 10 south, as it turned out I
had to cycle 7km south to get to the bridge, so I may as well have taken the
boat and stuck to the EV route.</p>

<p>Coming into my lunch stop, Nowi Dwor Gdanski, another end of the asphault, as
my road stopped in a village. But it was possible to ride over fields using
farmer's roads (around 50% concrete slabs and 50% mud/sand). When I rode into
the town it appeared to be quite a nice place, and I sat down for a
picnic-bench lunch next to the river. From there it was mostly plain sailing
to the city of Elbląg.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/4.JPG" alt="Field Road" /></p>

<p><em>Field Road</em></p>

<p>I knew this morning that Elbląg was under 100km, and therefore wouldn't be my
first choice as a destination, but it's the only city for 200km or so going
east on the EV 9, so it might be good to stay in a hotel before hitting the
trail tomorrow and riding around the border of Russia.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/2.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake</em></p>

<p>I'm riding around the border of Russia, because Russia has an enclave between
Poland and Lithuania - Kaliningrad Oblast. It used to be part of the German
Empire (as Königsberg), but was granted to the Russians after World War II.
Unfortunately you need a Visa to cross Kaliningrad Oblast, and it's not easy
to obtain, so I will give it a miss, bypassing it means cycling 200km inland,
which is fine as I can then cycle into Lithuania and head towards Vilnius.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the city, I checked hotel prices, and also checked the
distance to the nearest campsite or hotel on the EV10 route, finally I decided
to stay here after only 80km. I had a late start from the hostel (at 10:00)
and this city looks worthy of investigation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/3.JPG" alt="Tree-lined road" /></p>

<p><em>Tree-lined road</em></p>

<p>The hotel I found is "no frills" but very clean, and the staff are very nice.
After checking in (and leaving my bike in the lobby) I had a shower and went
into town and found an Italian Coffee shop, had a coffee and did some work,
and then asked where I could buy socks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/5.JPG" alt="The Hotel" /></p>

<p><em>The Hotel</em></p>

<p>I didn't think my missing socks (I forgot most of them, and only packed two
pairs) would be an issue, but after doing lots of walking, although far from
stinky, they are at risk of becoming that way, I will probably do a
clothes-wash at some point, but probably not for another week. I found some
socks in a supermarket at the recommandation of the waitress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-05/6.JPG" alt="My Room" /></p>

<p><em>My Room</em></p>

<p>For dinner am now in the hotel's retaurant - they speak German (most older
people can speak at least some German) and I asked for something vegetarian -
the old lady looked searchingly into space, and then said "yes, I can prepare
a soup, a soup with cream". The "soup" was actually more like a cold yougurt
with boiled eggs and cucumber and other things. But it was fine, to my
surprise I was then presented with three huge creps, a dollop of cream and
some jam. I would not ask for desert normally, but I looked happy, and dug in
to the slightly sickening sweetness, but couldn't finish everything.</p>

<p>Physically I'm still feeling good, other than being tired. I have sun burn on
my shoulders after wearing a vest on the second day, I only realised two days
later that simply wearing a shirt would not protect them 100% from the sun, so
am now putting some sun lotion on them daily. My lips have dried out, or
burnt, or something, and I found myself cycling or walking with my tounge
half-sticking as a moisturiser -- maybe I should buy some lip balm.</p>

        <div>
            <p>There was a buffer breakfast at the hotel, featuring feta cheese, bread,
cereals, and eggs. Again this morning I was feeling less than optimal, and
still half knocked out even after the breakfast coffee.</p>

<p>I had now the required component to fix my rear break -- the missing part was
actually very common, and is the same screw that is used to affix the drink
holders, so I could have easily cannibalised one of those.</p>

<p>My muscles ached in a dull way as I started cycling up the hill out of the
town but after ten minutes they felt fine.</p>

<p>The weather was colder today, and I had to find my summer-cycle-gloves and put
my jacket on (the gloves more because some rain and the associated chill
factor). I cycled past some lakes, on increasingly busy roads as I approached
Gdansk. The route was relatively unremarkable compared to yesterday.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-04/1.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>A Lake</em></p>

<p>The previous night I had obtained some Polish, Lithuanian and Finish lessons.
I didn't find any Estonian or Latvian lessons, but Estonian is closely related
with Finish, and Latvian with Lithuanian, so I should be covered. I did two
polish lessons today.</p>

<p>I have been attempting to speak Polish since being here, as I have done some
Polish lessons before, but I slowly realised when I was doing the lessons,
that I was actually speaking (extremely basic) Croatian. I had previously spent
three months in Croatia and picked some things up there. The two languages are
Slavic, and at the level I was speaking at mostly mutually intelligible,
but some of the things I said were far from the mark. Notably my "Do you understand
English" was the Croatian "Dali resumiem angleski?" when the Polish seems
to be "Che resumium po angelsku".</p>

<p>I also occupied my self by trying to "learn" hot to interpret the various
instruments on my wrist watch. One thing I had found to be invaluable on
previous tours was a compass. I have always had GPS, but it is difficult to
read in the sunshine and fiddly to turn the phone on, load the mapping app,
etc. With a compass you can easily and quickly check that you are at least
heading in the correct direction - having that facility often saves you from
cycling a prolonged distance in the wrong direction. The best compass I had
was a small one that clipped to my watch strap, but it fell off and I lost it.</p>

<p>Before I left I decided to look for a watch that had a compass built-in, and
after looking at all the options I decided on this Casio "Pro Trek" watch,
which has compass, barometer and altimeter (and some other less significant
features, like sunrise / sundown, etc).</p>

<p>The compass is great, it shows the basic direction and degree bearing. The
altimeter and barometer are less obvious though. The altimeter didn't fill
me with confidence in Berlin, the office would show as 50m on some days and
20m on others, it doesn't use GPS so not sure how it works at the moment.</p>

<p>I calibrated it to my GPS yesterday, and checking it again against my GPS it
seems to correlate within 10m (and the GPS altitude is far from accurate).
Like the compass, it can be used as a quick sanity check. Determining if you
are ascending or descending is not so easy, as sometimes your brain can
interpret the environment as descending, but in reality you are ascending, and
in these cases I'm going slightly mad wondering if something is wrong with my
bike.</p>

<p>The barometer shows the air pressure in hPa (Pascals), it's typically around
the 1000 mark. I don't really understand air pressure and its effect on the
weather, other than down is bad, up is good (if I remember correctly). It
shows the trend, and I am waiting for some bad weather to try and understand
how to interpret it.</p>

<p>For lunch I stopped at the half-way town in Kartuzy and sat in a burger bar
and had the only vegetarian thing on the menu - a toasted sandwich.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-04/2.JPG" alt="Katurzy" /></p>

<p><em>Katurzy</em></p>

<p>There was another liquid-related accident, as I had purchased an energy drink,
which I drank immediately, but seeing no bin anywhere, I put it in my
handlebar bag until I found a bin, it seems it was not entirely empty, so some
of the sugary liquid got out, and a small amount found its way to my camera
and the zoom control, which is now rather sticky. The lesson is to always put
liquids (especially things that are not water) in plastic zip bags.</p>

<p>From Karturzy, the minor road I was on met a major road, so I switched to
small country roads. From a brief look yesterday it looked complicated, but in
the end I was able to make almost a straight line to Gdansk.</p>

<p>I decided last night to stay in a hostel, and this morning I reserved in the
"Guitara" hostel, mainly because it was the first result on <code>hostelworld.com</code>.
When I checked in it was very matter-of-fact, and I was allowed to leave my
bike in the 24h hostel foyer for an additional 10 Zloty. I'm staying in an 8
bed dorm, and the bed seems OK. They have electronic lockers where I've put
all my bags. In the basement there is a large room with a kitchen, sofas, and
tables for breakfast (included). There is also a television.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-04/3.JPG" alt="Gdansk" /></p>

<p><em>Looking towards St Mary's</em></p>

<p>If I'm in a Hostel and there is a television, if ever I'm alone with it I'll
turn it off. I haven't got the nerve to turn it off when somebody is there
staring at it shoving food into their mouth. If I ever own a hostel, there
would be absolutely no television anywhere.</p>

<p>Besides the television there is also a piano, acoustic guitar and acoustic
bass. But unfortunately nobody can play them because of the television.</p>

<p>I've had a walk around the center of Gdansk, and seen the epic Saint Mary's
Church (2nd largest stone church in the world) and had an unremarkable pizza.</p>
