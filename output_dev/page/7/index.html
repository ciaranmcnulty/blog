            <h2><a href="/blog/2019/07/03/dabki-bytow/">Dabki to Bytów</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm glad that I turned inland. I decided to head to the town of Bytów which
was only 100km from the town, and would be a stepping stone to Gdansk. The
people I dealt with have all been unquestionably friendly and the roads have
been quiet.</p>

<p>I left the hotel without fanfare at around 08:00. I felt pretty horrible -
when I got into the hotel last night I looked in the mirror and I had heavy
bags under my eyes, and I felt like I had heavy bags under my eyes. It's the
100 mile look, more over 100 miles of which a good deal of those miles were
not easy. I managed to eat a large pizza and a whole bar of chocolate the
night before. In the morning the bags were gone, but I felt hungry and still
tired.</p>

<p>First priority was breakfast then. I rode east to the next town at which point
I would be able to take a secondary road south-east towards Bytów. The town,
unlike the others, was quite nice and had some history, there were normal
people here. I found an open cafe and ordered a cappuccino and a bakery snack
and sat outside the cafe in view of my bike, and the coffee helped to wake me
up. I then had a slow ride around the town, ostensibly looking for either a
bicycle or headphone shop, but really just exploring.</p>

<p>The wind has been behind me the whole time and today was no exception as I
cycled effortlessly down the quiet country road. I felt good and sang along to
the music which was playing in my head. I still didn't have any headphones,
but my brain seems to play it's own music anyway -- today it was Venus in
Furs (Velvet Underground), yesterday it was a Chopin Nocturne and I think
Pulp's "Common People" made it in somewhere.</p>

<p>I stopped at the next town and resolved to find some headphones, after cycling
around the small number of shops I settled on the only one which claimed to
sell computer accessories. I demobilised the bike outside the shop window and
went inside, on the left was a counter behind which were stacks of computer
accessories, on the other-side they were selling stationary. I found a display
with in-ear headphones, and after waiting for the guy to serve another
customer he greeted me and I asked if he spoke English: "Of course!" he
replied. He seemed so happy, and was obviously glad to be able to use his
English skills, after we had agreed on the pair of headphones I would buy, he
asked "How is my English?" I replied with "Dobre!" (good). It was just a
simple transaction, but it left a good impression on me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/1.JPG" alt="Headphone town" /></p>

<p><em>The town where I got my headphones</em></p>

<p>I was skeptical about the headphones -- I had never heard of the brand, and
they were the most expensive headphones of that type in the shop (€12) - twice
as much as the pair the guy had recommend to me in fact. So I was happy with
the quality, there was good low and high frequencies. The only problem was
that they were the weird, now standard, plug-into-your-ear-completely type -
ironically "for sport", but the effect is that you can hear all the low
frequency rumblings from anything that's connect to your body -- on a bike
this is the rolling sound and bumps on the road, when running the constant
thump-thump of your feet on the pavement. So actually, useless for sport. Best
suited to lying on your bed and not moving. Given a choice I always prefer the
type that just rest in your ears (peak circa 1999).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/2.JPG" alt="Improving cycle network" /></p>

<p><em>The cycle network has been quite good so far, and still under construction</em></p>

<p>I now had music available to play, this is a nice facility sometimes, as you
can get transported away, but equally you can rely too much on it. The most
practical benefit will be that I will be able to start doing some Polish
lessons (and maybe a language or two from the other countries I will visit, if
I can find any).</p>

<p>For lunch I had acquired an energy drink and a bread roll - so I stopped on a
bench and had a peanut-butter and nut sandwich, that is, peanut butter, and
mixed with some mixed nuts. My reasoning is that there is protein in there
somewhere.</p>

<p>I rolled into Bytów after a reasonable short amount of time relative to the
previous two days. It wasn't as easy as I thought to find a hotel, and I had
to google, and then it was much more expensive than I had thought (€35
compared to the €16 yesterday), but breakfast is included, and I'm not on a
strict budget.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/3.JPG" alt="Church in Bytow" /></p>

<p><em>Religion is still here</em></p>

<p>The bike was still missing the rear breaks due to the screw falling out on the
cobbles on day one, I asked at reception about a bike shop (via. google
translate) and she made two hand gestures indicating "turn right" then "left".
I left and surely found a bicycle shop, the young man who served me spoke
great English (most if not all young people speak good English). He provided
me with a new screw, for free, and I should now be one again at 100% breaking
capacity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/4.JPG" alt="Courtyard" /></p>

<p><em>Inside the Teutonic courtyard</em></p>

<p>The main attraction in Bytów is it's Teutonic Castle, built originally by the
Knight of the Tutonic order before changing hands several times and being
extended and rebuilt over the centuries. I had a look, and visited the large
and (at the time) rather empty museum for 10 Zsloty (around €2.30 or so). As
with all museums I felt chronically tired after visiting 30%, but I persisted
and found it interesting. At one point the only other visitor approached me
and started speaking in Polish, then in English asked me to "take photo".
"Follow!" he said. I followed him to the top room of the tower, where there
was a miniature of the castle as it would have looked in Medieval times, and a
knights helmet and sword for photographic purposes. He asked me to take a
picture of him with the helmet and sword for his son, who "really likes this
sort of thing". After doing this, he asked if I'd like him to take a photo of
me, and I agreed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/5.JPG" alt="Dangerous person" /></p>

<p><em>Stay away from this guy</em></p>

<p>After the museum I found a cafe, and worked for an hour on some open-source
project, then went to a Pizzeria opposite the hotel (what else can I eat in
Poland?). The woman there was also very happy to speak English with me, and
was very welcoming, I've now finished the Pizza and am still sitting here
drinking sparkling water (they had no beer).</p>

        <div>
            <p>Today has been a long day. I am now finally sitting in a Pizzeria in one of
the many pizzerias in a town which is one of many towns with many Pizzarias.</p>

<p>At the campsite I had a slightly better sleep, and think that I will become
accustomed to the uncomforted and learn to sleep better. The campsite was very
quiet, I woke up at around 5am, then tried to sleep again with some success,
finally sitting up, getting out of the tent, using the toilet, then coming
back and making coffee and porridge, before packing up. It had, as yesterday,
briefly rained in the morning before I exited the tent.</p>

<p>I rode out of the town and proceeded east, which is the only way I'll be going
for the next few days. I stayed on the main road, and noticed that my gears were
slipping.</p>

<p>My gears were slipping. This could mean one of four things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sand has gotten on the chain and sprockets.</li>
<li>The wheel is moving and needs to be fastened.</li>
<li>The part of the frame holding the derailleur has bent again.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the frame was bent I would be in it would be a big problems, if it had
happened towards the end of the trip it would be less bad, I could then force
it into shape and expect it to last another 20 days, but if it happened
only after 2 days it would be bad. If it happens at all it would probably mean
I need a new frame sooner or later. So this was on my mind.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/1.JPG" alt="The bit of my bike that could be bent but it isn't (apparently)" /></p>

<p><em>The bit of my bike that could be bent but it isn't (apparently)</em></p>

<p>I picked up an energy chocolate bar and a pastry at a small shop, then around
15 minutes later I pulled in from the main road into a picnic area and
sheltered from the rain. I checked my wheel for horizontal movement, I could
perceive none, then I checked the angle of the frame, it looked straight, then
I rubbed my fingers on the chain and sprocket, and I could feel no sand.</p>

<p>So the current status is the gears have gotten worse, and they are switching
randomly, but I don't know why. I hope it's just sand and that it doesn't get
worse.</p>

<p>It was raining intermittently in the morning, occasionally quite hard, and it
soothed my sunburnt shoulders now hidden under a shirt.</p>

<p>I was riding along the coast but I hadn't until this point had a direct view
upon the sea - the roads are typically sheltered from the strong
inland-blowing wind by trees. The wind was strong and the waves were blowing
onto the beach.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/2.JPG" alt="People walking on the beach" /></p>

<p><em>People walking on the beach</em></p>

<p>The Euro-Velo Iron Curtain Trail (13) is clearly marked on this part of the
route, and it looked as if sections of the cycle trail had been sponsored by
the European Union. There were dedicated bike paths along much of this part of
the coast, and some sections were <em>busy</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/4.JPG" alt="EV13" /></p>

<p><em>EV13</em></p>

<p>The first town I hit on the north coast yesterday was a model for the next 5
towns I would visit. There are at least 100 "holiday makers" in any direction
that you look. Each has a main street selling hats, swim suits, buckets and
spades. Pizzerias, Berlin Kebab Shops, and each has it's a fair ground which
looked identical to all the others.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/3.JPG" alt="Niechorze Lighthouse" /></p>

<p><em>Niechorze Lighthouse</em></p>

<p>The amount of people was astonishing, even on the rural cycle paths between
the towns people were passing at a rate of 10 a minute, I was slowed down by
cyclist congestion at some points.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/5.JPG" alt="Build more!" /></p>

<p><em>Build more!</em></p>

<p>I would say that the coast is saturated with tourists, and possibly there
could be less - bu then there were innumerable construction projects in forest
areas promising even more hotels, apartments, restaurants, fair grounds,
etc.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/6.JPG" alt="Build more!" /></p>

<p><em>Build more!</em></p>

<p>Each town seemed to be linked to the next with a cycle path, except one which
was being built as I (we if you include the other tourists) rode around the
digger and into the worst sand I have encountered anywhere that is not a
beach. Even as I was there, there were several tourists in front of me and
more behind me, all with mountain bikes and all falling off and being unable
to ride through the sand.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/8.JPG" alt="Very sandy road" /></p>

<p><em>Very sandy road</em></p>

<p>For lunch I tried to find another Perogi restaurant, but the density of
tourists made me not want to stop anywhere - I didn't have much food with me,
just a can of lentils, bread and peanut butter. So that's what I had for
lunch.</p>

<p>Areas like this make me uneasy - everything is where it is for the
tourists/holiday-makers, there is nothing to see except the same tourist
culture that you get in every other country in the world. The whole thing
seems to <em>unnecessary</em> and wasteful. I could imagine that the tourism companies
may well distribute people into one town or another and make them all the same
on purpose.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/7.JPG" alt="Blocks of Flats (unrelated to rant)" /></p>

<p><em>Blocks of Flats (unrelated to rant)</em></p>

<p>After finishing 100 I could not bring myself to stay at any one of the 100s
campsites. Each time I thought I would stay at the next town, it was just as
full and foul as the previous town.</p>

<p>At around 120k I turned in-land. Here the traffic died down, and the tourism
gave way to agriculture. At one point I passed a sign which advertised
"Agrotourism Camping 50m", I followed it to a house with "Agrotourism" painted
on the side of it, and a small sign saying "Camping" with an arrow pointing
into the garden. I entered but there was nobody there and not a tent or
caravan in sight.</p>

<p>I then rode through some villages, with absolutely no tourist influence at
all, each had a single village shop, and not much else. The only place that
looked as if it might offer me accommodation within a reasonable distance was
the coast, so I went back in. I decided to "be brave" and just take the next
possible accommodation (hotel, pension).</p>

<p>The next town was indeed the same as the others, just as many tourists etc.
The first place I tried was a restaurant that I thought offered accommodation,
but they didn't, the pension was upstairs and the directed me behind the
building, but I couldn't see anything obvious to do there, so I carried on
down the road, then I saw a sign for "Pension 50m". I went 50m and rang the
reception, a man greeted me "Dzień dobry" (Jean Dobray), I asked in my best
Polish if he understood English or German, he spoke German.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-02/9.JPG" alt="Buggys" /></p>

<p><em>Loads of these things</em></p>

<p>My bike is in the reception area of the Pension. The pension will cost 60
Zsloty (about 15 euro). The room is fine - the bed is a sofa bed.</p>

<p>I am a bit apprehensive about continuing along the coast tomorrow, if it
carries on like this I would much prefer to turn inland.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Didn't sleep too well last night. I situated my tent close the the main
building where there was a collection of tables and chairs, and these were
appropriated by another small group of cyclists. They operated at a reasonable
volume until 12, but as tents have absolutely no sound insulation, it's as if
I was there at the table with them. This drove me slightly nuts and I resorted
to playing music in my headphones to drown the sound out, while sweating in
the still uncomfortable heat, at midnight the small group called it a night,
and the temperature dropped and I was able to crawl into my sleeping bag and
sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning I woke uncomfortably. I am using a new sleeping mat - the one I
used previously was quite good, and I could almost guarantee a good nights
sleep, but it had a micro puncture (which I absolutely could not find) so
while it stays suitably inflated for 2 hours, it will be deflated after 4. So,
I got a new one at Decathlon. It's a half-size inflatable matress, and I could
probably fit three of them in the same space as the old one. The old one was
more comfortable however.</p>

<p>I lay in bed feeling awful and wondered why I was doing this. Then as the tent
started to heat up I rose up zipped open the inner tent and made a coffee with
my Italian coffee-maker, then I boild up some porridge - I didn't have any
sweeteners, so I just put a lump of peanut butter in, maybe the extra salt and
sugar would do me some good.</p>

<p>More or less efficiently I packed up the tent and left, waving good bye to the
now several cyclists who had all congregated at a table and were having
breakfast.</p>

<p>The Polish border was just around the corner, and I crossed the bridge over
the river Oder as if it were any other bridge in Germany (Poland is in the
Schengen zone, no passport checks).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/one.JPG" alt="Polish Border" /></p>

<p><em>Polish Border</em></p>

<p>The subsequent road was fifty-percent cobblestones, but a walkway proved a
good alternative to the road, when I entered the twon of Gryfino I stopped and
kept me eyes out for: 1. Bread, 2. Headphones. Bread would be easy to come by,
headphones not so much. I found neither, not did I look very hard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/two.JPG" alt="Bridge to Gryfino" /></p>

<p><em>Bridge to Gryfino</em></p>

<p>The not-drunk pensioner from the last night had shown me some routes to take
on the bike, and I checked my map to see if I could find them. I couldn't
remember exactly, but remembered some of the wiggly lines and lakes, then I
just decided to head North or North East, taking any road that isn't a
motorway.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/three.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Cobble #1</em></p>

<p>This policy led me to the second cobblestone road of the day, and there would
be more. This road ran for about 3km, and the cobblestones were shaking me and
the bike continuously, limiting the speed and causing me to question how much
of this punishment my bike could take.</p>

<p>After about 30 minutes I stopped for a photo, then pedaled forward and there
was one of those omninous <em>KLUNK!</em> noises. I stopped immediately and as the
sound came from behind had a look at my back wheel. The V-Brake was hanging
loose and had fallen into the wheel. It wasn't serious -- but the pin/screw
holding it in had been vibrated out of it's socket. I ran back about 500m to
see if I could find it (it would have been big enough to be easily seen). But
no luck.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/four.JPG" alt="bad" /></p>

<p><em>Don't forget to tighten your parts before riding on cobbles</em></p>

<p>I removed the loose brake - it should be easy enough to get a replacement pin,
but my bike is now front-brake only until I can find a bike shop.</p>

<p>I kept heading north, bypassing the city of Szczecin to the west. This took me
around a lake -- there was only the main road, which I guessed, would be
forbidden to cyclists. But the pensioner had mentioned smaller roads, and
indeed there were some green dotted lines on my map. I was also able to see a
cached version of a cycle-map overlay on the map -- which basically means that
when I zoomed out several times I could see a thick blurry red line which
indicated the path of the Euro-Velo Iron Curtain Route. It passed straight up
through the fields on these dotted green paths.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/five.JPG" alt="bad" /></p>

<p><em>Givin way to dreaded sand</em></p>

<p>For lunch (well, it was 11:30am - but I left early) I found a Perogi
restaurant, I had assumed it was a bakery, but was tempted by Perogi -- a
Polish food, "Tortellini" type wraps with fillings. The lady spoke a small
amount of German, and I was, (I think?) able to indicate that "No meat, No
fish", at least she then gave me a 2 Spinach, 2 Mushroom, and 2 of another
variety, which I don't think was meat. I ate in the retaurant being able to
look directly at my bike in front of the glass shop window. The Perogi was
sprinkled with roasted onion flakes, and it was good and would get me through
the rest of the day.</p>

<p>As I cycled through a small village which had a small road leading to the
start of the green dotted line -- I was surprised to see the sign of the
"Camino de Santiago" - the ancient network of pilgrim paths leading to the
city of Santiago de Compostella in north-west Spain. There are very old routes
leading from all corners of Europe, and very often the trails are supported by
hostels which will cater for pilgrims either for free or for a reasonable
price.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/six.JPG" alt="bad" /></p>

<p><em>Sign of the Camino</em></p>

<p>The road started off as cobblestones, before giving way to sand, then to large
concrete slabs.  It was not easy to traverse this section with the heavy
touring bike, the wheels would slide into the deeper sections of sand, and it
either took some extreme effort to pull myself out or the bike would slide
into motionlessness.  It was quite exhausting, but also good to be out in the
open country away from all traffic.</p>

<p><em>Sand</em></p>

<p>I didn't imagine doing another off-road excursion today, but as I made my way
to the main road, I reaslised that the main road was a motorway of sorts, and
cycling was explicitly prohibited -- so I checked the map and found more green
lines, and this was a pattern for the remaining 5 hours of the day.</p>

<p>The sand roads are the worst -- I am not sure why there is so much sand, but
its impossible to make good progress, and you are frequntly slowed to almost a
halt while the front tyre slides into a little sand pit, or you are stopped
completely, one I lost my balance and jumped off the bike, more often I kick
the ground to keep the bike on the right course.</p>

<p><em>Too much sand</em></p>

<p>Then there are the cobble roads - more consistent then the sand, but they
impeed your speed and rattle your bones, whilst potentially causing important
pieces of the bike to fall off.</p>

<p>Less frequent than either of these are the good-old dirt roads which are solid
and smooth, and littered with the occasional pile of rocks. Not many of these
today however, they probably all turn to sand eventually.</p>

<p>As I made may way I up, I passed through the town of Stepnica -- in retrospect
I remember the pensioner saying that it was "Ikea Town" - as I passed thorugh
there was indeed a large Ikea factory, with streams of blue-uniformed Ikea
workers leaving and entering the facility. On the right hand side of the road
was a hige lumberyard, on the left, the factory. I guess a large proportion of
this town worked for Ikea.</p>

<p><em>First glimpse of the sea</em></p>

<p>The target for today was the north coast, from where I would cycle east. It
had taken much effort and more time than anticipated due to the road quality,
so after 110km and 7 hours I decided to stop at the next camp site. Cycling
always on these green lines on the map, I made my way to what was marked as a
camp site. I followed a dirt road, to a chalk road, which led to a big ranch
-like gate, which looked abandoned, but the signs were still there and it
looked hopeful none-the-less. I arrived at the campsite, there was a large
house, and the whole place had a wild-west theme - but there was nobody there.
There was a reception, which asked to call at the house, which I did, and a
phone number, that I rang. But no response. It would have been a perfect place
to camp, precisely because there was nobody there. But I decided to carry on.</p>

<p><em>The Camp Site where nobody was home</em></p>

<p>The next camp site really was on the north coast, and due to the motorway I
was obliged to follow the green-line / pilgrims path the whole way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-01/eleven.JPG" alt="bad" /></p>

<p><em>This was the wrong path</em></p>

<p>Despite the extra effort, and slow pace, time actually passes quicker on these
roads - mainly because you have to focus the whole time on keeping the bike
moving.</p>

<p>When I got the the campsite I had targetted (in Witamy) I realised that I had
landed in a complete tourist trap. There were tourists everywhere, and the
campsite was just a field of camper vans, with a steady flow of white-shirted,
red faced, slightly-overweight people going in and out. I considered getting a
hotel, or pension (and everyother house was a pension), but as I cycled
further through the town I decided to just keep going east.</p>

<p>The road leading out was a minor/major road, the was reasonable frequent fast
moving traffic, and I was worried at times when drivers would give me the
benefit of half the road as they passed me, but then I would look on in horror
as they looked set on a collision course with traffic from the other
direction, and twice it was close enough for horns to be used. I decided to
ride on the grass shoulder after that.</p>

<p>The road was pleasant, and provided the first "mountain" of the tour -- I
think it could only have been 100-150m (my phone was out of batteries so I
couldn't check). I had now been riding for around 9 hours, and I was certainly
feeling tired and hungry, but my legs were still working well. Then I found
this campsite, which was not marked on the map, but when I pulled in, there
was a car pulling out and the man driving (his wife next to him) said in
perfect English that this was a very good campsite, and quite, well, apart
from the noise of the road.</p>

<p>The campsite cost 25 Zsloty, or around 6 euro.</p>
