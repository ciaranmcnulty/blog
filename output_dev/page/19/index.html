<p>I woke up this morning at 7am to the sound of pouring rain. The bed was
comfortable but I felt exhausted and my head hurt. I got up and looked in the
mirror, I had bags under my eyes. Yesterday was a hard day. Today would be
much better, but I didn't know it yet.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served from 7 and I went down at half past, the lady was already
there and had prepared my place. I had asked her the night before if she could
prepare a vegetarian breakfast, and I got the standard breakfast without meat:
an egg, cheese, jam, two bread rolls and a big jug of coffee. It was a good
breakfast and cost comparatively little, just €5.</p>

<p>I went upstairs and packed my stuff away, left the key in the door and went
down to bike, it was raining mildly and I dug out the cycle computer which I
had canibalised from my racer in Berlin. I wripped the old one off (I didn't
have the computer unit for it) and put the new one on, then I realised I
didn't steal the accompanying wheel-magnet from the Racer, but luckily the
existing one worked (as you would expect, with it just being a magnet, but I'm
sure I have had problems before, maybe to do with strength and sensor
sensitivity). I calibrated it to my 26" wheel, I hope. Otherwise my distances
will be wrong.</p>

<p>I set off. As already mentioned I didn't feel great, but was better for the
breakfast. Pretty soon my legs and hips started aching, and it got gradually
worse for about an hour and I wondered if I would even make it to Bremen. If I
stopped the bike and put weight on my right leg it would seize up painfully.</p>

<p>I noticed that the pain happened most significantly when my leg extended, and
the seat was quite high, I lowered it and it was immediately better. Over the
subsequent hour it got gradually worse but then it just got better again.</p>

<p>As with yesterday, it alternated between rain and wind and sun. Occasionally I
would feel a warmth run though my body and I thought that this was my immune
system (or something) kicking in - maybe it decided that this level of exertion
wasn't going to stop, so it did something about it. Whatever happened I was
soon at a self-sustaining level and 3 hours after I started I knew I would
have any more problems. I am now sitting in the campsite and my legs feel
fine.</p>

<p>The route was mostly flat today, which accounted for my good time, I managed
to keep an average speed of around 20kmph, my overall average is lower because
I cycled through Bremen.</p>

<p>It was about 65km to Bremen from Diepholz and I was there at around 12:30 in
time for lunch. I was looking for places to sit down, got to the toilet and
buy a drink. Its usually quite to rare to find all three of these things
together (and I have often postponed my lunch by hours just looking for two of
them) so I was happy when I encountered the banks of the Weser. There were
many benches (with back rests) all the green, grassy, banks. There was a
mobile toilet (good because I could keep my bike close), and a kiosk.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-22/IMG_20180622_131040.jpg" alt="River Weser" /></p>

<p><em>River Weser, Bremen</em></p>

<p>I went to the loo, got a Club-Maté drink (€1.80 - pretty expensive) and sat
down and cracked open a can of baked beans and the stale bread buns I had
bought the day before.</p>

<p>I cycled through the center of Bremen, and saw the Bremer Dom (Bremen
Cathedral) and the Alte Rathaus (old town hall). Very gothic looking
structures. I also saw a strange large tower, and I wondered if it was
Europes tallest Minaret - but it was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallturm_Bremen">Fallturm</a> (literally fall
tower) in which 9 seconds of weightlessness can be produced apparently).</p>

<p>I would have liked to have stayed longer in Bremen, but this trip is all about
getting as far up the west coast as Norway as possible in a month.</p>

<p>Not wanting to be stuck for accommodation again I had downloaded the offline
map Lower Saxony which includes POIs (Points Of Interest), among which are
campsites. There was a campsite in the town of Zeven which I guessed would be
around the 100km mark, so that was my destination.</p>

<p>I rolled past the 100km barrier and felt good. Probably could have kept going
all the way to Hamburg, but again maybe a bit too early in the tour for really
long distances.</p>

<p>The cycle network in Germany has been really good, I haven't cycled on a
single busy road, there are always cycle paths, and most of them are pretty
good.</p>

<p>In Zeven I have found a great campsite (Camping Sonnencamp). It cost €10
(showers included) and I have pitched my tent next to a shelter with a picnic
table inside, and there is a power outlet. It is peaceful and the sun is out.</p>

            <p>Time and distance are estimates as I still haven't hooked up my cycle
computer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-21-map.png" alt="Bielefeld to Diepholz Route" /></p>

<p><em>Very rough map</em></p>

<p>I am sitting on the bed of my room in the hotel Strangmeyer in
Diepholz. I had planned to make it to Bremen today. I estimated it to be
135km, I would head north west and join the D7 cycle route which would take me
first to Bremen and then I thought I would carry on the next day to Hamburg. I
didn't make it to Bremen, I only made around 95km and there is still another
70km to go to Bremen.</p>

<p>I knew that this first journey would be an experiment - I have done no
training at all - the last time I rode any significant distance was in
August last year. My journey lasted for about 7 hours. My legs were resisting
and became sore. My bum is also sore. These are to be expected, but I didn't
expect pain in my fingers and wrists.</p>

<p>The third finger of my right hand has some muscle problem now (due to pulling
the break lever) and I noticed early on that my left wrist became quite
painful from being constantly engaged on the handlebar. I had this issue once
before a years back and it crippled me for a week or so. So I took precaution
to not put any more unnecessary pressure on it.</p>

<p>I woke up in the Bielefeld campsite this morning at about 7:00am and made
myself a coffee using my Italian coffee maker (the first time I have used one
for camping) and put the contents into my thermos mug. I then started chucking
all of my gear out the tent onto the grass so that I could pack it up.</p>

<p>The bike was on the back of my brothers Land Rover, I haven't seen it in over a
year. My father has been riding it in that time and mentioned that the breaks and
rear tire would need replacing. Luckily I had 2 sets of spare break pads in my
bag from my last tour, so I set to work replacing and adjusting them. It
started raining.</p>

<p>The weather forecast was ominous. Four days of rain.</p>

<p>Break pads were replaced but the breaks still were not working very well, I
made a personal engineering breakthrough when I realised that the reason they
didn't work well was because the v-breaks had no tension and were
loose. The v-break has a spring which pulls it away from the frame, the spring
is hooked through one of three holes in different positions. The breaks were
in the middle position, I moved them to the third and they were much better (I
guess the springs are not as good as they used to be).</p>

<p>So happy that now my breaks are better they have been for years.</p>

<p>This took me some time and it was raining constantly and I was exposed. When I
finished I jumped into the land-rover and woke my brother up (he was sleeping
in the car and his friend in the tent). I was feeling a bit dizzy and shaking.
I made a peanut-butter sandwich and finished my coffee and made to leave.</p>

<p>The previous night we had all sat down in the campsite's biergarten and eaten
pizza and drank a few beers. It turns out we had left the shower keys (you
use the coupon and get charged after the fact) in the biergarten. But they
found them and were happy to give my brother new ones.</p>

<p>I said goodbye to my brother and cycled out of the campsite. Wondering if I
had forgotten anything. The weather improved, the sun came out. But it would
alternate between gusty rain and sunshine all day.</p>

<p>The campsite was located south of Bielefeld (over the Bielefeld Berg[1], or the
Teuton burger Forest). And I cycled over the Bielefeld Pass. In Mitte
(center) I went to the bakery and got 2 chocolate cookies and set off.</p>

<p>The path was not clear to me at all, and there was no direct route, so I ended
up zig-zagging my way up to Bad-Essen - which explains the extra
distance.</p>

<p>I tried reciting my memorised poetry collection (I had 6 poems, including The
Waste Land and The Raven). I tried 5 and couldn't finish any of them, I think
they will come back to me though. It's a good resource to have and I could
keep myself occupied for an hour or more when I could remember them all.</p>

<p>The breaks were replaced, but I still needed a back tire, it was smooth, there
was no tread left on it at all. When the Schwarbe Marathon tires ware down too
much they reveal a green color, which I think means "replace me now". There
was much green.</p>

<p>In Bad-Essen I found a pretty large cycle shop, and immediately found the
required tire. I asked if I could replace the tire in the shop, and they were
good enough to replace it for me. The bike was outside and the mechanic
insisted that the baggage be removed (I just wanted to give the wheel). They
put my baggage <em>outside</em> in the street, it wasn't many people and it was a
small town but this worried me, while I didn't want to be awkard by moving it
all inside the shop. I waited and guarded my luggage for about 20 minutes
while the wheel was replaced. It cost about €54 including puncture repair
patches and a water bottle.</p>

<p>I still need to get tire levers and some gloves.</p>

<p>It was cold at points today too, when it was raining and the wind was blowing
at me my hands were going numb. I have gloves and will dig them out tomorrow.</p>

<p>For lunch I pulled into a forest track and sat down on a log. I had a
bread roll, peanut butter and assorted nuts. Shortly afterwards I found a
bakery and topped with with an apple cake and a fizzy drink,</p>

<p>At around 16:00 I realised that I wasn't even half way to Bremen (I started at
around 10:30) and that I could realistically be there if I carried on until
22:00 - but my body was suffering, I could have pushed through but would have
caused myself damage one way or another. Epic 10 hour rides will have to wait.</p>

<p>I decided to stop early, my current waypoint was where I am now, Diepholz, I
hoped to find a campsite, but when I got to the center, the nearest was
another 10km away, and in the wrong direction. I must have been looking lost
because a man asked me if he could help, I said I was looking for a campsite,
he suggested "Dümmer See" - but again it was 10km in the wrong direction. I
asked about hotels.</p>

<p>"Do you know any hotels in this town"
"Yes, but I don't know the prices", he was thinking, "there is a guesthouse /
pension Strangmeyer"</p>

<p>I didn't understand all of what he said but got the directions and followed
them. When I entered there was lots of people eating in the restaurant and the
owner was very busy attending to them, but she managed to give me the key for
the room and let me put my bike around the back.</p>

<p>They were serving food, but I thought I would try my chances in the town -
oddly all the restaurants seem to stop serving at 20:00, and I was confused
when I asked in an Italian restaurant "We start serving at eight" - "but it
<em>is</em> eight" "No we stop serving at eight" and he looked at me like I was a
mentally challenged (my German still sucks).</p>

<p>I ended up eating a simple Falafel Dürum from a Turkish Imbiss. I crowd of
young kids were hanging around outside. The Dürum only cost €2 and it was
slimmer than the ones I'm used to in Berlin (less salad). But it was good.</p>

<p>Now I need to plan where I will go tomorrow, passing surely through Bremen.
Hoping there will be a campsite at around the 100km mark.</p>

<li>I climbed over this "mountain" the evening before with half of my touring
equipment, it was heavy work and probably explains some of the issues I had
today.</li>

        <div>
            <p>It has been decided that I will get the train to Bielefeld tomorrow. I have a
ticket from Berlin (€53 direct train, 3.5 hours). There is no going back now
(it's an inflexible ticket).</p>

<p>My bike has been picked up from Weymouth and is being driven across England
now as I write this blog. At around 19:00 hours tomorrow I should be picked up
from Bielefeld station by my brother and escorted to a camp site where I will
be reunited with my bike.</p>

<p>It has been about one and half years since I last toured. My equipment has
been distributed across vast distances and some of it, seemingly lost. But
luckily I still have some of the original artifacts from my first tour 8 years
ago across France, including the following camping stove:</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-20-kit.jpg" alt="Kit" /></p>

<p><em>Rusted but not useless</em></p>

<p>The bike will likely need some maintenance, it wasn't in great shape when I
brought it back from France, and since then my Dad has been riding it on a
daily basis, running into the ground. But it's made of sturdy stuff (Steel
actually). With new tyres, breaks and some tender-loving-care, it should be
fine.</p>

<p>This state of my equipment in London visible are 2 of my 4 panniers, an
inflatable sleeping matt, sleeping bag, tent, jacket, convertible pants,
gloves, cooking equipment, first-aid kit, emergency blanket, an exploding
laptop battery, cable ties, a lamp and a can of Slovakian baked beans (2014
vintage).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-200-camping-gaz.jpg" alt="Camping Gaz" /></p>

<p>It was reported that the tent has "seen better days", it has suffered from
mold. But it was a good tent, and I think it will be fine with a new
compression sack and a good airing.</p>

<p>The greater mystery is what happened to my other 2 panniers. The first is a
known unknown: I brought it to Berlin, and it vanished when I moved to my new
flat. The second, a large rear pannier, cannot be located in London or
Weymouth. I have already purchased a replacement for the first from <a href="http://www.der-aussteiger.de/">Der
Auststeiger</a> and if the other one doesn't turn
up, I will to make another visit.</p>

<p>The last missing item is my portable USB charger: this is an important item,
as my phone is my navigation, and if it runs out of power I will probably need
to talk to people.</p>

<p>So I will be investigating both batteries and solar power in the hours
available to me tomorrow before I set off.</p>
