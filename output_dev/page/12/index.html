<p>When the girl came around to collect the money for camping, it was actually
very cheap, only 60kr (about €6) - cheapest so far, almost by half.</p>

<p>It was quiet enough and I was initially camping on the tent pitch on my own,
but later joined by two other tents, but they were at a good distance from
each-other and not noisy in any case. There was a small party happening in one
of the caravans on the other side of the site making noise until around 12,
inducing me to put my ear-plugs in as I read three chapters of "Memoirs of a
Geisha". Thankfully the noise stopped at around eleven and I slept well until
the morning.</p>

<p>This morning I used the last both of my coffee and my jam. The coffee has
lasted me all this time from Berlin, and I have been drinking a cup a day
(except in the youth hostels where I used their coffee). The Jam also has
lasted since Germany.</p>

<p>I was only at most 70km from Trondheim, so I was in no hurry to leave the
campsite, but ended up leaving at around nine anyway - if there was a chair
and table where I could sit down and work, I might have stayed, but working in
the tent, with my legs folded and the laptop resting on one of my panniers, is
not super-comfortable, and I always experience stretching pains when I stand-up
after sitting cross-legged after a certain duration.</p>

<p>I left the campsite cycling the wrong way but soon realised my error and
turned back. I was listening to the Manic Street Preachers (Gold Against the
Soul), but then changed to another audio-book. Yesterday I did 4 chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655">Howard
Zinn</a>,
today I did three chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens</a>.
Sapiens is also a history, but a pre-history history. So far telling the tale
of the different genus of "homo" of which we, "sapiens" are only one species
of many which used to exist. Lots of profound ideas.</p>

<p>I stopped at a supermarket ("Coop"). As I stopped I didn't really know
<em>why</em> I had stopped, it has just become a routine to stop at a supermarket
once a day. Once inside I just picked up a pastry and two rolls of bread, and
also was able to use the supermarket guest WiFi. I payed in cash, but debated
buying more stuff and paying with card.</p>

<p>I only have 150kr left in cash now, and about 4 days ago I realised that every
time I drew cash from the cash machine, it charged me €6. I had always tried
to take the minimum amount of cash plausible from the machine as I don't want
to leave the country with too much remaining. But if I'm only taking out €40,
then €6 is a very high surcharge (it seems to be a fixed fee). Using the card
"only" costs around 69 cents. But that makes no sense when buying a few bread
rolls and a cake (€3.75).</p>

<p>The cycle route into Trondheim was pretty quiet, and it was cycle paths all
the way to the center. It is the third most populous city in Norway, but has a
low population of 193,000 compared to more populated countries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Statistics!!!</em></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Number of days: 23</li>
  <li>Distance: 2362.3km</li>
  <li>Average per day: 102.69km</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I got to the hostel I parked my bike outside and went in, the reception
was closed but a girl said "hello" and said "check-in is at 15:00" (it was
around 13:00) but she proceeded to open up the reception anyway, and then
found my booking and let me know that the room was already made up and there
was another person in it (otherwise I could put my bike in the room) and that
I could check-in right-away.</p>

<p>Outside I met an old woman who looked my bike up and down "You checking in
<em>here</em> ?" "Yes. I just checked in" "<em>really</em>?" "err, yeah" "ohh, very lucky,
you are very lucky, they don't let people check in until 15:00".</p>

<p>This old lady seems to be a resident, or part of the staff, I'm not sure. But
she stalks around the place checking that everything is in it's right place
and correcting people continuously so that you are likely to make a mess just
out of spite. But I'm sure she means well. But it's a very different
atmosphere from Bergen, but also the facilities are excellent - the bunk beds
are very solid and the facility is modern, and there is a large cupboard of
free food. It cost around €34 for a single bed in a four bed dormitory.</p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>For dinner I have just finished a pizza. It has been 8 days since my last
pizza in Bergen, and it;s nice to have a change from soup.</p>

<p>This evening I need to research my options for getting back to Berlin. This is
potentially, effectively, my last bicycle destination. My first plan is to get
the train to Oslo, and then the train to the south of Sweden in order to get
the ferry to Germany, where I will again get the train. But maybe there are
other options, and maybe I will need to do more cycling before I see Berlin
again.</p>

<p>The plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunday 15th rain to Oslo on Sunday, stay in hostel.</li>
<li>Monday 16-18th: Ride to Gothenburg</li>
<li>19th Train to Malmo (they leave regularly) and cycle to Trelleborg</li>
<li>20th Trelleborg ferry 18:00 arriving in Sassnitz (also leaving at 07:45)</li>
<li>21st Train from Sassnitz to Berlin. 2 regional trains.</li>
</ul>

            <p>It appears to be Friday the 13th. Today was a hard slog, most of the route was
hilly and there were no "natural" rests along the way - no ferries or tunnels
or places of note. I stopped for lunch at the top of a long climb.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-13/IMG_20180713_114911.jpg" alt="Valhalla" /></p>

<p><em>Valhalla</em></p>

<p>It was cold again last night and hard to get to sleep, I woke up multiple
times and ended up putting my trousers on in the sleeping bag and pulling my
arms inside of my t-shirt to achieve a level of comfort. I think next time I
will get a warmer sleeping bag.</p>

<p>I am now about 60km from potentially my last stop - Trondheim. I have already
booked the hostel, or at least I hope I have. I emailed them this morning,
they replied saying that they had beds available, and I replied saying that I
would take one, then left. I have no mobile internet, but later in the
afternoon I was in a supermarket and there was WiFi. I checked my emails and
they said that I should receive a booking confirmation. I didn't receive a
booking confirmation, so I emailed them back to confirm. However, as of now I
still have no internet, so there is a slight possibility that it is not
booked.</p>

<p>In the supermarket (arriving after my lunch) I got a pastry and two bread
rolls. The bread rolls were advertised as "2 for 20kr". That made me think, oh
hey, that's a good deal. Only after leaving the supermarket did I reflect that
I just paid about €2 for 2 bread rolls which would have cost at most 70 cents
in Germany. I neglected to get some other supplies - namely Onions and Lentils
for my soup tonight, so will have to make do with what I have left.</p>

<p>When I stopped for lunch, as previously mentioned, it was at the top of a long
climb. There was a picnic area (I was hoping there would be) and already two 
groups of people eating there, one group was leaving, and as I sat down on a
vacant table a motorcyclist talked to me.</p>

<p>He was from Heidelberg in Germany, and was impressed with my journey. He had
actually done my route on motorcycle, getting the ferry from Hirtshals and
riding up the coast to Trondheim, and he will now ride back down to Oslo. I
didn't ask how long it had taken him, but it's taken me two weeks. We spoke
mainly in German, and it was one of those cases where my German was only a bit
better than his English.</p>

<p>I passed another cycle tourer when riding down a hill, she was a young woman
riding alone - the second I've seen so far. Most of the cycle-tourers I've
seen or met have been cycling in pairs, I can only recall seeing two solo male
tourers on the road (excluding the tourer I met in the hostel in Bergen)</p>

<p><em>The Road</em></p>

<p>At the campsite I was lucky to have a power outlet by my tent, and Wifi
access. I was able to fully charge my power-pack and phone, and this morning I
downloaded some audio-books. "Sapiens" (a history of human kind) "The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich" (which was recommended) and Howards Zinn's "A Peoples
History of the United States".</p>

<p>I listened to over four hours of Zinn today. It's a book that is controversial
with the political right in America, as it presents history from the point of
view of the subjected - the native Americans, the indentured labourers, the
black slaves. And really presents the dark side of American history.</p>

<p><em>Cracked Road</em></p>

<p>I was glad to get to the campsite, the last part of the journey raised me to
an altitude of almost 500m - the highest so far that I'm aware of. The
cycle-tourer in Bergen gave me the impression that some passes were 1000s of
meters, but he may have been referring to the mountains rather than the
passes. None of the climbs have compared to the big climbs in the Pyrenees or
the Alps.</p>

<p>Feeling quite worn out, I think I'm going to make something to eat.</p>

            <p>This morning I woke with a stomach ache and there was lots of groaning as I
packed up my damp tent and filled my water bottles and tenderly made my way
back to the road.</p>

<p>The sky was and is overcast and has been so all day, but it hasn't been
raining.</p>

<p>The cycle route went indirectly around the coast, but there was another road
cutting straight across the land which saved around 15k. I wanted to make it
as far as possible today. There is a stretch to Trondheim of around 70k
without any campsites, so I wanted to get to the last one before that.</p>

<p>The road took me on to Norway's <a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/northwest/listings-northwest/national-tourist-route-atlanterhavsvegen/11862/">Engineering feat of the
century</a> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean_Road">Atlantic Ocean Road</a>. It took 6 years to build and was partially financed by tolls until 1999 when
the tolls were removed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_115229.jpg" alt="View from atlantic road" /></p>

<p><em>View from the Atlantic Road</em></p>

<p>This was the first time I really smelt the salty sea air as I rode over the
scattered mini-islands and bridges. There was lots of tourist traffic, and
camper vans, and people walking about on purpose-made bridges, clambering on
the rocks and looking at the sea.</p>

<p>I stopped for a coffee, my first coffee in Norway, it cost only 20kr (~€2) and
was filter coffee served in a paper cup. It tasted good though and made me
feel better.</p>

<p>After this I was riding to the end of the cycle path - or rather to the
Kristiansund tunnel through which I was required either to take a taxi or get
the bus.</p>

<p>As I rode up there was a cycle-route sign which provided me with this
information, it didn't say how often the buses ran though, it only gave me a
website, which I couldn't check, because <em>I have no mobile data</em>. Fortunately
there was a timetable across the way, unfortunately it had been battered by
the elements and was mostly illegible, but I could make out the possibility
that the bus ran maybe every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I waited, and very soon a bus appeared and pulled in. The driver got out and
put my baggage in the hold and I put my bike on the bus (there was a
wheelchair space). The bus could have carried 60 people, but there was only
one other passenger on this ride. It cost around €7. The tunnel went
underground and covered around 8km, when we exited the tunnel the driver
continued to the bus station in Kristiansund where I got out.</p>

<p>I had previously this day gone into an Intersport shop to try and find some
Camping Gaz, they didn't have any, but they suggested I try in Kristiansund,
so this was my first priority.</p>

<p>I first tried a hardware store, and they referred me to a maritime store. I
asked in English if they had any Camping Gaz, and they did. I paid (€14) and
said "Mange tak" (many thanks), and in return I got a "Har det bra" (goodbye):
my first successful Norwegian language transaction! Later in the day I also
managed to understand the amount I had to pay at a supermarket without
reverting to English.</p>

<p>I didn't stay long in Kirstiansund, I made my exit, riding through a section
of the harbour which seemed like a working ship-building museum.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_151524.jpg" alt="View of Kristiansund" /></p>

<p><em>View of Kristiansund from a bridge</em></p>

<p>I had now done about 75k, it was 15:00 and I hadn't eaten anything, and didn't
feel particularly tired or hungry and I was soon on the Tømmervåg ferry (cost
€4). On the ferry I made myself a sandwich while the other passengers helped
them selves expensive self-service food. 25 minutes later I rolled off the
ferry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_174734.jpg" alt="Another view from a bridge" /></p>

<p><em>View from a bridge, not on Kristiansund</em></p>

<p>This was the last ferry before Trondheim, and very probably the last ferry in
Norway on this trip. I'm not very sad - the ferries are a pain, and while most
of them have been running regularly, I have had issues with some that required
me to wait for so many hours, and of course they cost money.</p>

<p>On the final stretch it was very quiet - other than the periodic batch of
traffic from the ferry. A racing cyclist pulled up next to me, he was an older
man (probably retired) and we had a chat for around 10 to 15 minutes, the
normal stuff, where I'm from, where I'm going, where I'm <em>eventually</em> going,
etc. He recommended the campsite that I'm staying at now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_180904.jpg" alt="Clouds" /></p>

<p><em>Clouds</em></p>

<p>This campsite showed up on my map as "INTERNET-ACCESS: FEE CHARGED". Which
doesn't make it sound overalls appealing, but there was no other option (there
was another campsite, but it was on an island which required another ferry
trip).</p>

<p>The Wifi is however, is very free indeed (no password required). They also
have a kitchen (and the cooker doesn't cost anything). Today I bought some
dried peas, and I'm trying to cook a mainly pea soup, the peas have been
cooking for an hour now, and still not mushy, don't think they are the right
kind (think I should have gotten split-peas), but hopefully they will be soft
enough to be edible.</p>

<p>My final destination, Trondheim, is still around 170km away, which is
certainly doable in a day, but it wouldn't be a pleasant day at all. So I will
stay at another campsite tomorrow, and hopefully book a hostel in Trondheim,
or buy a train ticket and get the night train directly.</p>
