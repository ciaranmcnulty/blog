        <div>
            <p>I don't seem to have succeeded in integrating very well in the hostel I've
been staying in for the past 2 days, having not really broken the ice with
people in general (with some exceptions) and feeling a little depressed and
drained. Most of the staff and guests are relatively young (one girl, 18, is 
still at high school in Italy) so maybe it's the generation gap. I did have a
good chats with a guy from Wales, and another from Helsinki.</p>

<p>My activities have been running, programming and drinking (coffee by day, beer
by night). Being careful not to run to fast (due to recurring injury) I have
managed to do to ~8-10k runs, following the same route, through the beautiful
"victory park" (??) running along the stream, crossing the bridge over the
river ---- then running down to the next one and crossing back and running
through the old
town.</p>

<p>Like Vilnius, Riga has a huge number of churches and God doesn't seem to be
dead here, religious thought is given to the deceased in the countless
well-kept grave yards I have encountered on the route, whilst graveyards are
usually abandoned in the UK, here there it seems there is almost always some
people walking about, maintaining the graves and paying their respects, even
in otherwise remote areas.</p>

<p>Today I visited the "Museum of the Occupation", if you google this museum you
will see a large and impressive building, rectangular with black slate panels.
This building however is undergoing renovation, and the museum has been moved
to a building in a series of embassy-like buildings just outside of the old
town.</p>

<p>Admission to the museum was an optional donation, I donated €5 and walked
upstairs. The "museum" was really just three rooms, each with a numbered
series of panels. Each room presenting a different era of occupation starting
from the end of World War I when both Germany and Russia had to relinquish
their claims on the Baltic states leaving them to declare independence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-16/1.JPG" alt="Electric Arch" /></p>

<p><em>Some kind of "Electric Arch" with the Nativity Cathedral showing in the
background</em></p>

<p>This ended when Nazi Germany and the USSR agreed to partition Poland
between them and for the Baltic states to be incorporated into the USSR. They
immediately started deporting natives and importing Russians, deprecating the
currency and persecuting political "enemies".</p>

<p>In 1941 however Germany declared war on Russia and invaded and occupied the
rest of Poland and the Baltic states, and applying their Jewish policies. In
1944 the states were "liberated" by the Red Army, and then the situation
reverted to the original Russian occupation, and this continued for 50 years
until 1991 when Mikhail Gorbachev instigated economic reforms and the Baltic
states decided that now was the time to declare themselves independent, the
Russians attempted to regain control by force, but eventually an agreement was
made and the states become once again independent.</p>

<p>Around 800,000 Russians were bought in to the country during the occupation
(the Germans immigrated 180,000, but all were forcefully expelled at the end
of the war). Apparently in 1981 the percentage of Latvians in Riga was only
36.5%.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-16/2.png" alt="Freedom Monument" /></p>

<p><em>Freedom Monument (taken from Wikipedia): Errected in 1918 to celebrate
Latvian independence and surviving to present day</em></p>

<p>I guess I will move again tomorrow - I will go north east, to the national
park and the town of Cēsis where there is a castle and some hotels, from there
heading into Estonia, aiming maybe for the town of Tartu before going to
Tallinn.</p>

<p>I researched options for returning to Germany today -- the boat from Helsinki
will cost around €250, not including the €50 ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki.
Which is more expensive than I imagined. There is also a bus option -- which
would cost significantly less (and take 27 hours).</p>

            <p>The road suddenly changed from a very smooth asphalt road to the worst kind
of gravel road, and showed no sign of stopping. Potentially running for the
remaining 50k to Riga, cars would drive past kicking dirt into the air which
would sting my eyes and force me to angle my cap down to avert the dust, which
consequently meant my field of vision was restricted to what was immediately
in front of me.</p>

<p>The two energy drinks I had forced my temper to break at a couple of points I
was shouting angrily at the road. It was the third long day in a row and
sometimes I regretted making it so. I had the option this morning of riding
all the way to Riga on the primary road, a total distance of around 100km, but
I had assumed it would be too busy, and perhaps boring. My alternate route
would rejoin the (planned) EuroVelo route, but required trekking back 5km to
the turning, then heading 20km North, before "resuming" my journey west to
Riga. But finally I'm glad I did, it was almost certainly more interesting
than riding 100km primary route (even if it was Sunday and there was not much
traffic).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/6.JPG" alt="Dust" /></p>

<p><em>Dust - by the time I got the camera ready the worst was over</em></p>

<p>The slightly zany lady at the hotel prepared my breakfast, but I don't think
she understood me when I told her I was vegetarian the previous night, or she
had forgotten, as she brought out a plate with two large boiled sausages, with
gherkin, tomatoes and cheese, with bread, jam, honey, butter, and a yoghurt. I
did my best to eat everything but the sausages, but it was too much, and when
she brought out another 4 slices of cheese I tried to say no, but she assumed
I was being polite, and that I really did want the cheese.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/1.JPG" alt="Ruiner manor" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined Manor</em></p>

<p>Some other guests (possibly family) were having breakfast, and the lady used
them to translate to me "Daniel! (speaking in Latvian, or Russian) - "You can
stay in your room until 12" and so on, last night she was switching to another
level of conversation by asking if such-and-such was the right word in German
("Setzen sich" oder "Setzen!" "Setzen ist Richtig?" and she was even writing
down some phrases and used my phone to translate if I wanted herbs on my
dinner. He name, I found out eventually, was Kristi, and I said goodbye and
thank you as I cycled back up to take my alternate route to Riga.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/2.JPG" alt="Grass Hopper" /></p>

<p><em>Grass Hopper - these things make lots of noise</em></p>

<p>Today again I spent lots of time listening to Howard Zinn's book. Today was
about the organization of Labour movements from in the 19th century, the
Spanish-American war and subsequent American empire building in the
Philippines. Each chapter is around 2h, and there are at least 22 of them.</p>

<p>The route was particularly picturesque today, I passed through a few
isolated villages, and an industrial area that nature was reclaiming, and
often the road was very smooth and from a small altitude you could see a
landscape of boundless forest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/3.JPG" alt="Flat landscape" /></p>

<p><em>Flat landscape</em></p>

<p>There was a headwind, as I was now cycling into the great wind which had
propelled me from Berlin, but it was not to severe, however at one point I did
question why I was struggling to maintain 20km on a flat (according to my
altimeter), even with the wind didn't seem strong enough to account for it, I
thought to check my rear brakes.</p>

<p>I picked up the rear of the bike by the seat and kicked the wheel to spin it
with my foot - as I suspected it moved but then stopped: the brake was in
contact with the wheel. I adjusted the brake to give it more power to pull
back from the wheel, and also lubricated it. My gears have been very stiff recently
also, and I also lubricated the place where the cables pass under the drive,
and that made them easier to change, and the bike seemed a <em>bit</em> faster now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/4.JPG" alt="Ruined factory" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined Factory</em></p>

<p>I had a couple of energy drinks today, one more than normal, and felt a bit
high, and then irritable, especially when my bike ran over the ruts in the bad
road vibrating everything violently and the cars drove past followed by plumes
of dust blinding me. One energy drink is fine, two is too much for me, like
beer.</p>

<p>The approach to Riga reminded me of the approach to Vilnius - just a big road
for 3-5km where I tried to stay on the pavement, the hostel was easy to find,
which is just as well, as my phone's internet ran out of internet without
warning today.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/5.JPG" alt="Lookout" /></p>

<p><em>Lookout Tower</em></p>

<p>This was annoying -- I had received no text at all when I crossed any border,
and no text when I had used, f.e. 80% of my allowance, and only a text when it
was <em>all gone</em> and with no apparent suggestion on how I can get more. Fucking
useless.</p>

<p>I was approaching the hostel but could only see a McDonald's, on closed
inspection the McDonald's also had about 10 placards on either side of the
door, about 5 of these were hostels, and one of them mine. I expect they are
all owned by the same person. I wheeled my bike awkwardly through McDonald's,
through a door on the opposite side, my hostel was on the 3rd floor, so I
de-mobilised my bike and took my phone and laptop bag and ran up 3 flights of
stairs, rang the buzzer, was invited in but then I said "I have a bike", "Oh,
well, we don't have much room, but I think we can.." "OK, then, I go get it!"
and I ran down the stairs and then back up with my mostly laden bike and a
few unnecessary grunts as I struggled carrying the heavy thing up all the
stairs.</p>

<p>There were around 6 people sitting in the central common area, the beds look
very good and solid, there are "pancakes" for breakfast, beer is taken on a
trust system, where you tally your beers with a pen (but then each costs a
whole €2, and there is an off license downstairs selling beers for €1), and
tonight there is a free vegetarian lasagna - it's being served in 5
minutes, but I'm not in the hostel, I went for a walk to find a pizza and a
beer in order to write this blog post.</p>

<p>So far Riga is not the cheapest place, the Pizza I just had is probably one
the cheaper places, and it cost €8, and the beer €3.50 - more or as expensive
as Berlin, but I guess this is the tourist area.</p>

<p>It is now only 3 days by primary road to Tallinn - the planned end of the
tour, and I am now 2 weeks in and have 2 weeks left - so I might stay in
either or both Riga and Tallinn for longer periods (and also perhaps take a
more scenic route to Tallinn, but this could only add a day or two).</p>

            <p>As normal I slept not to well on the campsite, but woke up at 06:00 and made
breakfast (coffee, porridge, and some pastry things I found in a shop) and was
out on the road at around 08:00 heading to the Latvian border.</p>

<p>It looked to be another sunny day, yesterday I had worn my vest for the first
time since being burnt over a week ago, and was annoyed that I had burnt again
in the same place, I sprayed some sun lotion on to my back and put on my shirt
instead of the vest.</p>

<p>I headed north-north-east passing lots of lakes including the town of Dusetos,
making my way 50km to the Latvian border where I crossed to the Latvian town
of Subate. It was now 11:30, and I pulled off the main road and cycled to the
center of the village, found the (super)market and purchased a beer and some
peanuts, before sitting down on a bench in the nice green square and making
lunch (hard cheese blocks in dark bread pasted with peanuts peanut butter to
hold the peanuts in place). I also got some chocolates which was dangerous as
all 6 were quickly dispatched and I decided buying chocolates is always a bad
idea.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/2.JPG" alt="Latvia" /></p>

<p><em>Latvia</em></p>

<p>I idly looked up the Wikipedia for what now seems to be a village, it used to
be a larger settlement of around 2,300 people in 1914, now it has only 940,
it's entire Jewish population was murdered during WW II.</p>

<p>I had an option in around 10km of either turning west and finding a place to
stay in the 2nd biggest city in Latvia, Daugavpils, which would have made
around 100km, but I decided against it when I couldn't see any affordable
accommodation, and decided instead to head towards Riga and build up some more
spare days.</p>

<p>After passing the point of no return I listed to an audiobook, I thought I had
"Bill Brysons Short History of almost Everything", but instead I had Howard
Zinn's "A Peoples History of the United States" and I spent 4 hours listening
to 4 chapters: How women were oppressed, How the Indian lands were taken, The
Mexican War (invading Mexico), and a chapter about the abolition of Slavery and
the civil war, but to be honest my concentration was waning at this point. But
it passed a great deal of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/1.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lots of lakes around these parts</em></p>

<p>It wasn't at all clear where I would rest tonight, Jekabpils was the logical
place a largish city, at around 130km, but there didn't seem to be any
accommodation or camping there. If I couldn't find any accommodation there then
there was a town 15km further on which ostensibly offered a campsite and some
motels.</p>

<p>The road today was extremely flat after some initial hills, passing into
Latvia I noticed a number of what I guess are nuclear bomb shelters in
peoples gardens.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/3.JPG" alt="Bomb shelter" /></p>

<p><em>One of three back-garden bomb shelters I saw today</em></p>

<p>The road was mainly surrounded by forests, at one point this changed to a
massive clearing of freshly dug earth, it looked as if an enormous amount of
forest had been cleared and the earth turned over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/4.JPG" alt="Missing trees" /></p>

<p><em>Missing trees</em></p>

<p>I passed through Jekabpils without seeing any accommodation (I did see a
Motel on the way out, but it was on the wrong side of the road, and anyway it
was raining and somehow I had already decide to ride to the next town). It
started raining and I hit a main road to Riga.</p>

<p>There was no other option that to take the two lane road with it's traffic and
lorries. Unfortunately there are no asphalt hard-shoulders in either Latvia or
Lithuania  (possibly also Poland) only gravel which is not fun to cycle on,
and possibly even dangerous if attempting to pass over it at speed. This is
where my mirror comes in handy, and with constant attention I can ride on to
the hard shoulder when big lorries burn past without risking a close shave.</p>

<p>Around this time my phone battery died, but the way seemed clear enough in my
memory and I crossed a bridge and turned left, following the lake that the
town of Plavinas lives on, and started looking for the hotel. Without my
phone's GPS I wasn't sure exactly where I was going, and I asked a local, who
happened to be a kid of around 14, and he spoke English and was able to
respond to my question negatively when I asked him if there was a Hotel in
either direction.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/5.JPG" alt="Approaching rain" /></p>

<p><em>Approaching rain</em></p>

<p>I carried on down the road, and went to the effort of connecting my phone to a
battery and found the Motel I had seen on it in the morning, I headed to it,
but couldn't see any motel, then looking around more closely there was a dirty
house with "Motels" written on it, but it didn't look like anybody was home
and I might find a better place later so I continued, there was another Motel
and then the campsite.</p>

<p>The next Motel also looked empty, there were no cars out front, and I could
see no movement or lights (although it was day). I pulled up, there was a bar
building on the left, and the "Motel" on the right. I tried the door to the
motel, it was open, and I went upstairs, and said "Hello?" but there were only
rooms. When I came back down there was a lady that had appeared from the bar
"Do you speak English?" she shook her head and beckoned me to follow.</p>

<p>The lady knew a few words of German, and assumed that I was German, and was
surprised that I was English when she checked my passport. She's a little
strange, but very accommodating and she ensured that my bike was secure and
inside (she wouldn't let me leave it in the car park locked up). She called my
"Thomas" for a good while, which was fine, until she asked if that was my
name, and I said "Daniel, but Thomas is also fine!".</p>

<p>She later entered the bar holding her cat "Daniel!" (she starts most
sentences addressing me with either "Thomas!" or, now, "Daniel!") This is my
cat, tiger" (or similar).</p>

<p>The room is quite expensive, €38, including breakfast. I had hoped to pay more
in the line of €20, and I probably wouldn't have stopped if I had known the
price (the campsite should be just another 100m down the road). But it's fine,
I only paid €4 for the campsite last night and the breakfast should be good
for the push tomorrow to Riga.</p>

<p>After crashing out for an hour, I came down to the bar and ordered dinner -
explaining that I was vegetarian, I was going to order chips and cheese, but
instead the lady recommended dumplings. In the end I had dumplings with
mayonnaise, a beer, and some bread.</p>

<p>I will stay at least 2 nights in Riga, the length of time I spend depends on
how much I like the hostel (assuming I find one), I would be quite happy to
spend a bit more time there if it's good.</p>

<p>My bum is sore to the point approaching uncomfortability for the first time,
perhaps it's the accumulation of the past two weeks, or just doing two 8 hour
days back-to-back.</p>
