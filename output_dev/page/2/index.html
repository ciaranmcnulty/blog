        <div>
            <p>As predicted I slept terribly, falling initially to sleep but soon waking up
as my head wasn't comfortable (it was supported inappropriately on my hoody which
was in turn supported by my food pannier). As usual when I realised that it
was morning and I could get <em>out</em> of bed, falling to sleep was no longer an
issue and I didn't wake until 9am. So I slept badly <em>and</em> got out of bed late.</p>

<p>I washed the remnants of last week's breakfast from the pots and pans and
cooked porridge, and ate the rest of the cheese slices.</p>

<p>The previous night I found and phoned ahead to the "Looming" hostel in Tartu,
and this morning I was surprised to find it already bookmarked on my map -- I
think somebody must have recommended it to me in another hostel, although I
don't remember it.</p>

<p>It attracted me as it was a so-called "art" hostel, and looked good, although
on <code>hostelworld.com</code> the beds for both 6 and 12 room dorms were advertised at
€30. I thought this must have been a mistake, and when I checked the website
they were advertised at €17/€18. So I phoned and got those prices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/1.JPG" alt="Quiet" /></p>

<p><em>Quiet road with cycle path, group of school children running on cycle path in
far distance</em></p>

<p>There was a cycle route all the way to Tartu, with distances regularly marked,
but there seemed to be a discrepancy, as I estimated 80k to the city, but the
cycle path said 108k. On checking it made a significant detour, which I was
able to avoid, infact I ended up doing the last 10k on the main road.</p>

<p>In general the cycle paths were very good, and even the gravel sections were
fine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/2.JPG" alt="Drive-by" /></p>

<p><em>Riding past a lake</em></p>

<p>After 40k I stopped for lunch, and found some "real" bread in the supermarket,
albeit bread with raisins in it, but it was freshly baked and tasted good.</p>

<p>At one section a primary school class and accompanying adults seemed to be
running down the cycle path, and three older boys (who presumably started
before the 5 year olds) were overtaking them running at a good pace and I
wondered if running is a part of physical education here, or just a special
event. There were also more than a few people with cruising on the paths with
"dry skis" (skis with roller-blades), something I never saw in
Latvia/Lithuania.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/4.JPG" alt="Panorama of field" /></p>

<p><em>finds panorama mode on camera</em></p>

<p>The MP3 player backlight has now completely gone, but I was somehow able to
put it into random mode, and listened to a good random selection of songs for
the few hours prior to arriving in Tartu by the aforementioned, busy, main
road - although I did manage to turn off before hitting the center by crossing
a railway track.</p>

<p>The hostel seems good, if a little expensive (although I think it's average
here in Estonia). There is no free breakfast, or free coffee, but they do have
a strong ideology, everything (decoration, furniture) in the hostel is made
from recycled/second-hand materials, and they are keen on you minimising waste
and the hostel's ecological footprint etc. They have a large terrace (which is
worryingly next to the dorm, but they have a 11:00 quiet rule) and the bunk
beds are sturdy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/5.JPG" alt="Rebase" /></p>

<p><em>Always advocating git rebase</em></p>

<p>One guy in my room was at the Metallica concert - the old man at the campsite
yesterday evening had mentioned that there was a concert in Tartu, and that
consequently all the chalets and beds were booked out (the campsite was 80km
away from the concert).</p>

<p>I did some work for a few hours, and then went in search of a pizza and beer.
I found a Pizza place and sat down, ordered a beer, but the waiting time for
Pizza was 60 minutes, so I opted to order pasta instead, which is a shame as
the pizzas here look really good, and the pasta I could have happily made that
myself and it would have tasted the same.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/6.JPG" alt="Freight train" /></p>

<p><em>Freight train</em></p>

<p>I think I'll stay here for another night, it seems to be around 300km to
Tallinn, which would presumably be my next "rest" stop and I have around 10
days left.</p>

<p>The title of this blog is "Berlin to Helsinki" but originally it was to
"Tallinn", the only reason it was to Helsinki was because I intended to get
the ferry back, but the ferry will cost at least €250, not including the €50
crossing to Helsinki, and the €100 for trains from Kiel to Berlin. The
alternatives are bus (27 hours) or plane, both of which will require me to
pack my bike, but after getting some bike-packing tips from Stefan (wrap it in
clingfilm and cardboard for the sharp bits) I think this shouldn't be too much
of a problem.</p>

            <p>At the hotel I settled down with a few beers and Series 8 of of Game of
Thrones, I hadn't watched it up until this point despite being, like most
other people, a big fan of the earlier seasons, but it had got progressively
worse and I predicted this, the final, series would be mediocre, it wasn't
great, but none-the-less still intriguing enough that I watched 4 episodes
back to back.</p>

<p>I woke up relatively late and had the included buffet breakfast, accidentally
picking up a splodge of what I assumed to be a vegetarian-friendly, mayonaised
salad, but then realising with some regret that I was eating some kind of
meat. The rest of the breakfast was standard cheese, cucumber, cereal, coffee
etc.</p>

<p>I picked up my bike which was locked in the shed, the chain and gears had
suffered with the rain and sand, with rust showing on the, now dry,
de-lubricated chain. I washed it down with some water and sprayed lubricant on
it then left, heading directly to Valka/Valga, the twin towns on the border of
Latvia and Estonia, which was around 80-90km north-east. I left at around
10am.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/1.JPG" alt="Promise of rain" /></p>

<p><em>Promise of rain</em></p>

<p>Although the weather forecast (for Riga at least) predicted it would not rain,
it did rain for an hour or just after I took lunch at the town of Smiltene,
where I looked for a bakery. I haven't found a single bakery in all my time in
Latvia (although I did see a couple of pastry/cake shops), and none of the
supermarkets I've visited have fresh bread, only nasty pre-packaged bread.
This town was no exception, and in the supermarket I picked up only some
"vegetable paste" and some pre-sliced cheese. I sat down on a bench and pulled
out some of the packaged rye-bread I had purchased around 5 days ago and the
top slice had already signs of mould, but the next one seemed fine.</p>

<p>As the rain poured down I tried listening to music. About a week ago, when
camping, in the rain, I had left my MP3 player in the grass overnight, and it
had gotten soaked through, surprisingly it still works, but the backlight has
progressively gotten worse to the point now where it is nearly impossible to
see the screen, and the headphones I purchased, despite their initial quality,
have also degraded to the point where music sounds klangy and actually not very
musical at all. But for audiobooks it's fine, and I carried on with Zinn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/2.JPG" alt="Valka" /></p>

<p><em>Town sign</em></p>

<p>At Valka I crossed immediately to Valga, and passed the erstwhile border
checkpoint to Estonia. Stefan had said that he felt Estonia had more trees, as
Lithuania already had quite a few trees, I wondered what "more" trees would
look like, and indeed when riding out of Valga there were more trees. Very big
trees, I think the ones I passed today were all managed forests, and
occasionally sections were cleared, and other sections newly replanted, but
mostly just big trees on either side of the road. The weather had improved and
there was a mild wind, the sun, and the rustling of the wind blowing through
the big trees.</p>

<p>Stefan also mentioned that there were bears here in Estonia (and the other
Baltic countries). This has crossed my mind a few times, although I'm sure any
danger is virtually non-existant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/3.JPG" alt="Estonia" /></p>

<p><em>Estonia</em></p>

<p>The other thing I noticed when crossing the border was that the roads improved
significantly - not only was there asphalt on the yellow roads on my map, but
some of the lesser white ones too. Estonia I think has a better economy than
Latvia/Lithuania, and I expect things to be a little more expensive (actually
both Latvia and Lithuania <em>seemed</em> more expensive than Poland, especially
regarding hotels).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/5.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Section of cleared forest, some trees are usually left standing</em></p>

<p>I had originally considered staying in a hostel in Valga, there were two, but
didn't commit myself, the other option was a campsite/hostel about 14km
further, which is where I am staying now. I checked out the hostel in Valga,
but it didn't look appealing, it was a large concrete, featureless house with
a closed door, and I suspected it might rather be a cheap place for locals to
stay rather than a travellers hostel (it didn't show up on <code>hostelworld.com</code>)
so I moved on.</p>

<p>Not having any internet, the only thing I had which made me believe there was
an isolated campsite/hostel 14km away from Valga was the offline map on my
phone, which in no way guarantees a place is open, or even if it still exists,
but I was relieved when approaching to see official "Hostelling Estonia" signs
pointing to my destination on the rural country roads.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/4.JPG" alt="Estonia Hostelling" /></p>

<p><em>Hostelling sign - previous one had "Estonia Hostelling" written underneath</em></p>

<p>When I arrived the reception was closed but soon an old man appeared and
greeted me. He was very friendly and showed interest into where I was from,
and when I wrote down my address in the registrar he even knew the road I
lived on in Berlin, as he was frequently there when he was younger - it
occurred to me later that he would have been in his prime during the Russian
occupation. He was not the first to ask if I studied in Berlin, which is
always a bit surprising as I finished studying almost 14 years ago.</p>

<p>Drinking water is taken from a pump which pumps ground water from 70m below,
there is a place to make a fire with lots of wood, and the man sold me a
couple of beers and some bread.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/6.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Large trees on either side</em></p>

<p>I had the option to stay in a bunk bed, or camp. I chose to camp, I'm not sure
why. It's cheaper, and it has it's charm, and this is a perfect place to camp
(there is no noise other than the rustling trees). But I am almost certainly
not going to sleep well tonight, but that has the benefit of starting early
and probably arriving in Tartu at around mid-day, hopefully with a hostel
booked.</p>

<p><em>Campsite, flag poles out of shot on the left have Estonian, EU and German

<p>Seeds are falling from the trees today, and as I'm typing this and looking
ahead of me I can see hundreds of little seed-particles blowing around, there
are several on my laptop keyboard.</p>

<p>Today was a good day for cycling, despite the rain earlier, the weather has
been perfect.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Typing this in a Pizzeria as usual, but unfortunately my laptop's power was
drained s I'm typing this awkwardly on my phone. I am in Cēsis, an historical
town 100km north-east of Riga.</p>

<p>At the hostel I woke relatively late, 9:00, and was able to take advantage of
the free waffles for breakfast, washing them down with a good deal of free
coffee.</p>

<p>After two days rest my arse was road worthy again. I was glad to leave the
hostel, having not really been succeeded in being effectively social and felt
detatched (for no good reason), but I was also reluctant hit the road again,
lacking mental energy.</p>

<p>I did however openly discuss my trajectory during my stay and heading
northeast towards Tartu in Estonia looks like a good target, it has about 4
hostels and apparently is a student town - and would take me through this
town, Cēsis which is famous for it's castle (again related to the once
omni-present Tutonic knights).</p>

<p>There was a cycle path accompanying the main road out of Riga which alternated
sides of the 4 labe,busy, road. This ended after a period however and I
switched to forest and country roads, before the main road split a.d the
traffic was much reduced. I flowed this until the town of Sigulda.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/1.JPG" alt="Road out of Riga" /></p>

<p><em>Road out of Riga</em></p>

<p>Here it started spitting raina and the sky had the now familiar even leaden
pregnant look which gave this spitting rain the significance of predicting a
heavy downpour. Cēais was off the main route and I headed north east out of
the town and the asphalt gave way to the beloved gravel, soon after tgethunder
started rolling and it rained hard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/2.JPG" alt="Back to sand" /></p>

<p><em>More sand</em></p>

<p>I also discovered that I was riding on the "tour de LatEst" cycle route, which
is marked on my map and which goes at least to this town, and probably all the
way to Tartu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/5.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>LatEst</em></p>

<p>The gravel-sand is more problematic in the rain, and the sand grains are
attracted to my gears causing them to crunch, grind and vacillate (??).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/4.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>These caves entrances were scattered everywhere at Līgatne</em></p>

<p>I avoided energy drinks today and managed thus to avoid road directed
tantrums, instead again listening to the Howard Zinn book and largely ignoring
the road, rain and thunder. I seem to be missing around 10 chapters and was
fast forwarded to the Clinton administration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/6.JPG" alt="Bridge of Doom" /></p>

<p><em>There was a diversion which I missed, and this bridge was the cause of it -
luckily I could cross (even if I risked being impaled by the exposed iron
works)</em></p>

<p>I had stopped for a coffee in Sigulda outside the train station, I sat down and
they had free wifi. (no password - which seems much more common here than in
western europe in general), and I booked hotel in Cēsis, there were campsites,
but, well, I could book a relatively cheap hotel (€30) with breakfast and
get a good nights sleep (hopefully).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/3.JPG" alt="Sigulda" /></p>

<p><em>Sigulda</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow the weather hopes to be better, and I will ride to Valka/Valga - the
twin cities separated by the Latvian / Estonian border, where I will endevour
to stay in a hostel (there seems to be at least one), after that the next stop
is Tartu,</p>
