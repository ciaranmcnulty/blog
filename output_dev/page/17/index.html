<p>I am now on the ferry crossing to Norway. Feeling a bit hungry but unwilling
to pay the €30 asking price for the on-board buffet (the ticket cost €42) but
everything has gone to plan so far.</p>

<p>Woke up early after a good nights sleep, had muesli again, but this time mixed
with jam in addition to water, and drank my morning coffee from the camping
cooking pot - which is actually better in some respects than the thermal mug
as it loses heat quickly, meaning I can down the whole lot after about 1 minute.</p>

<p>I drank a bottle of beer (33cl) last night and returned the bottle - in
Denmark they also have the deposit system with bottles.</p>

<p>I left the campsite, turned left and continued on the cycle path. It went onto
the now familiar gravel and dirt tracks, with very steep sections requiring me
to change into the highest gear. Sometimes my back wheel would slip in the
gravel as I pushed it up, on the way down there was often either deep gravel
or sand which could cause momentary loss of control. I cycled for about 45
minutes, and then hit a village.</p>

<p>I thought I had better verify my course, so I pulled my compass out. I was
heading south. Hmm, maybe I'm reading it wrong. Nope. I was heading south. I
switched on the GPS. I was almost exactly where I started.</p>

<p>Somehow I had done a complete circle in 40 minutes. The cycle path was
interesting and certainly made me sweat, but I realised that that whole detour
was completely unnecessary, and by going back down a section of path I had
returned on, I could rejoin it at the desired point.</p>

<p>From thereon it was plain sailing, I decided to run on the main road and
kept a steady speed of around 21kmph until I was in Aarlborg. Stopping on
route at a "Bagerei" to get an actual Danish pastry. It was like the typical
English danish but with cinnamon and chocolate on top, it was delicious. I
also got some bread for lunch.</p>

<p>I didn't stop in Aarlborg and continued straight on to Hirtshals. The boat
would leave at 5pm. I had plenty of time, and at my current rate would get
there with almost 2 hours to spare, but better earlier than late, and I didn't
know if I would have hassle with tickets or going to the wrong port.</p>

<p>The sun was out today, but it didn't seem as hot as yesterday. I took
precautions with my feet by wearing socks to shield them from the suns rays,
but it was probably unnecessary.</p>

<p>For lunch I found a picnic area, but there was no shade. Accross the road
there was a water tower with hige columns supporting it and a door in the
center. I sat on the door step and had my now stable lunch: Baked beans and
beer, actually had trouble eating the whole lot, although I had already ridden
60km by this point, I had eaten well last night, and the 60km were relatively
easy, mostly on flat ground.</p>

<p>At around 3:00pm I found myself riding up to the Fjord Lines check-in. I
queued behind two cars and got my passport ready. I said hello and handed my
passport, but she was expecting a ticket. I asked if I could buy a ticket now
and she said yes. "How much is it?" "314kr", "Perfect! Here is 500kn". And I
fiddled about with my money trying to find 14kr. "You can keep the change".
"Really?!??!" She said, I pondered. "It's 200kr" (about €26). "Ah.. maybe
not", she was amused and said that she should have said "OK".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-28/IMG_20180628_191022.jpg" alt="Looking out towards Norway" /></p>

<p><em>Looking out from the ferry to Norway</em></p>

<p>As of today I hadn't spent half of the money I took out when entering Denmark,
so was hoping I would have enough to get the ferry. I still have around 250kr
left.</p>

<p>I cycled up my allocated lane, it would be another 45 minutes before the ferry
arrived. I had bought a beer for the wait and sat down reading the news on my
phone. It was very windy and I wondered if this is the sort of wind I can
expect when cycling up the west coast.</p>

<p>First impression of Kristiansand: tourist pit. I think I expected a quiet town
like the ones I had passed through in Denmark, but the tourists are here in
force. I know I am technically part of the problem, but if everybody was like
me at least we'd be spread out and not congregating in towns filling the
sewers with our waste.</p>

<p>The campsite was about 3km or so away from the town center, and it's not bad.
It's packed, but quiet and I have pitched me tent on a little plateau near a
large rock and some trees. On my map it said it was a 4-star site, not sure
what that means, but other than toilets and showers, the only extra is the
kitchen with the same ridiculous hot-plates that I spent 1 hour cooking my
dinner on last night. The price was 160kn (about €16) and the shower was to
cost an additional 30kn (over €3) so I turned it down and instead performed by
ablutions in the sink instead.</p>

<p>I managed to charge my laptop on the boat, but my main power pack will probably
last only another couple of days. I'm hoping to stay in a hostel tomorrow, and
if I do, and it's cheap enough, I may take a rest day.</p>

            <p>Today marks 7 days of cycling and I'm in good shape, so far I've covered
around 806km. I'm slightly behind my so-called "schedule" as I had intended
to be ready to get the ferry to Norway today, but I will only be able to do
that tomorrow with some effort.</p>

<p>Slept adequately last night, but was uncomfortable due to the deflating
air-mattress, I think the other night I was camped on softer ground. I wanted
to head straight to Viborg, and saw the tempting "13" road, but wasn't sure if
you were able to cycle on it.</p>

<p>I lingered around the reception for a few minutes planning my next steps and
saw a man walking to go about his business, I asked him if he spoke English
and if he knew if I could cycle on the road.</p>

<p>"It is the old road that ran from the top of the country to the bottom, we
have the highway now. You can cycle on it ... what time is it?" I showed him
my watch "yes, now should be OK, it should not be too busy" "Is there a cycle
lane", "No, no cycle lane". He then asked me the usual questions about my
journey and I said thanks and made my way to the road. I had an opportunity to
rejoin the EV3 cycle path 2km further on.</p>

<p>I could see lorries as I approached the small 2 lane road, and felt slightly
vulnerable as I was cycling along it (although it was not that busy, and I
probably wouldn't think twice about it in England, but you get used to the
security of cycle lanes). A bit further on a saw a sign-posted cycle route to
Viborg, and I took it. It was basically the same one that I would have taken
anyway.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_094541.jpg" alt="The Road" /></p>

<p><em>The Road</em></p>

<p>I made good time and had quickly covered the distance to Viborg, on the
approach I was riding along side of the lake, but it was masked by the
sun-bleached foliage and you could just see glimpses of the rippling
waters.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_120254.jpg" alt="Lake at Viborg" /></p>

<p><em>Lake at Viborg</em></p>

<p>Searching for lunch I stopped after around 50 and got my self an expensive
beer, when checking out the young girl said something to me, I tried to
imagine what it could be, it didn't sound like a number, so assumed she was
asking me if I had a loyalty card. I shook my head, obviously the wrong
response as she then said "Twenty", "a ha!". I looked into my wallet and asked
how you said it in Danish and it didn't sound much like I would have expected.
But I repeated it anyway and she nodded, verifying my pronunciation, and now
I've forgotten it. "Are there any parks near here?" "No, but there are two
lakes" "Benches?" "Yes, lots of benches". I had a tentative look around, both
lakes were in the wrong direction, then carried on.</p>

<p>I found the next village 10km later, and found a nice bench in some shade. I
was concerned about my beer getting warm, so I stashed it deep into my rear
pannier and it was still pretty cool after half an hour. Baked beans and beer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_132006.jpg" alt="Lunch" /></p>

<p><em>Lunch</em></p>

<p>The heat was oppressive at this point. My lips were dry and I was rationing my
water, keeping my salt levels up with a steady intake of salted peanuts. I
don't normally mind the heat as long as there is enough water, but that's only
after my skin has adapted to the sun. Now I was aware of the potential of sun
burn. Upper legs, hands and feet were all risky areas and are slightly burnt
but should come around with a good tan in a few days.</p>

<p>Lots of horses, lots of hares, big dragonflies, The horses are interesting,
they are usually in groups and once they were all running down a huge field
together beside me, often they can be seen necking each-other in family groups.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_145122.jpg" alt="Rough path" /></p>

<p><em>Rough path, ants everywhere!</em></p>

<p>While I have lost a few things on the way, somethings have come back into
service - my MP3 player was water damaged when I left and stopped working, it
has now dried and provided me with music for most of the day. My cycle
computer has also, so far, returned to a working state after it mysteriously
reset itself twice yesterday (the battery cover was not fully closed, which
might have explained it turning off... time will tell).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_161818.jpg" alt="2 True" /></p>

<p><em>Self explanatory</em></p>

<p>I am now in a campsite, like the campsite yesterday they have cooking
facilities, but the cooker is very slow, and my soup has been cooking for over
an hour now and has yet to boil. Hoping to eat my dinner and sit down in the
TV room and do some programming whilst charging my laptop.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-27/IMG_20180627_172908.jpg" alt="Another forest road" /></p>

<p><em>Another forest road, with runner in the distance</em></p>

<p>I chatted with a guy in the kitchen, he lives on the campsite but had
previously been cycling to Gibraltar and Sweden. I mentioned how expensive
(beer) was compared to Germany, and he said that Denmark was cheap compared to
Norway. Glad I'm doing this on a paid holiday.</p>

<p>He also mentioned the camping rules in Denmark - it's legal in state forests
to camp <em>without</em> a tent for one night, and in some places there are
designated camping areas. I actually investigated one today but it was overrun
but a scout group. But it is nice to have a shower and <em>possibly</em> benefit from
other conveniences such as Wifi, shower, electricity (although Wifi hasn't
been forthcoming).</p>

            <p><em>My cycle computer broke today, I don't know how many kilometers I did or how
long I was riding for, this was the zeroeth problem. But it was a good day</em>.</p>

<p>At 11pm last night it was still light. I slept well. I didn't wake up until
7am, and then dozed and woke up late an hour and a half later. I made my
coffee and had muesli (moistened with water). I packed up the tent, as I
pulled out one the pegs there was a sudden crack and the tent changed shape.
Puzzled, I inspected it and the tent pole had cracked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-26/IMG_20180626_085347.jpg" alt="Broken Pole" /></p>

<p><em>Broken Pole</em></p>

<p>The previous day I had found a zip bag with a chrome metal tube in it, it was
covered in fine brown mud-dust. It was the emergency "pole repair kit" which
normally is stuffed away inside the tent, but had decided to escape. I didn't
realise I would be needing it the next day.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time this has happened with this tent either, two years
ago it broke in exactly the same way and I tried to repair it with a generous
amount of duck-tape (the solution lasted for about 2 hours). Then I found a
camping shop who fixed the pole for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, the pole is broken again and the emergency slide-over tube is holding
it in place.</p>

<p>This was the first "problem" of the day. The second came to me 30 minutes
after leaving the campsite, I was thinking about the coffee I had drunk this
morning, and then I remembered that I hardly even started it, then I
remembered putting it on the platform of the chalet I was camped next to. Then
I remembered that I didn't collect it. This was very annoying as it was a good
thermal cup and I could have doubled back and added another hour to my day,
but I didn't.</p>

<p>The third was taking the wrong turning at Kolding. Looking at the map now I
can't even remember what I did. But I was on the wrong track again, I had
intended to join the EV3 track on day one, but I missed it. So the plan was to
join it today. I would continue on the path I was on and rejoin it later.</p>

<p>The cycle tracks took me through some beautiful countryside. Lots of pine trees
and quiet forest roads. I rode into a valley at one point, riding up a very
steep incline, then descending into a vast plain with cows and horses and
birds before ascending the other side and descending once more.</p>

<p>Most of the day was spent on these roads and in this beautiful countryside and
all of the day was sunny. Very sunny. My hands were slightly blistered from
the afternoon sun yesterday, luckily I had the dregs of some sun lotion with
me which I applied liberally to my exposed hands. But so far the rest of me is
holding out, feet and nose are slightly red. Hopefully my skin will adapt
before I am a blistered mess.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-26/IMG_20180626_121632.jpg" alt="Lots of hills" /></p>

<p><em>More than a couple of hills like this</em></p>

<p>When I finally joined the EV3 it took me to the town of Jelling where I
stopped for lunch. I found a supermarket and then searched for a place to sit
down, behind the supermarket I could see a large mound which looked like some
sort of public area, so I had a look. There was a large field, two large
mounds, a church, a ring of strange markers surrounding everything and a
museum "Enter the Home of the Viking Kings".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-26/IMG_20180626_133421.jpg" alt="Enter the home of the Viking Kings" /></p>

<p><em>Museum at Jelling</em></p>

<p>Jelling is where the first Monarchs of Denmark ruled from. The strange markers
outlined where the "stone ship" was laid out, in which were two apparent
burial mounds, and two stones - the "Jelling Stones". One raised by Kind Gorm
in memory of his wife, the other celebrating the conquest of Denmark and
Norway. This later stone is the first recorded use of the word "Denmark".</p>

<p>I sat, drank a beer and ate my can of baked beans and watched a robot lawn
mower going about its business.</p>

<p>As I continued I noticed lots of Christmas tree plantations - and thought what
a waste it was to grow trees all year only so they could be used for a few
weeks and then dumped on the streets of Berlin.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-26/IMG_20180626_165652.jpg" alt="Nice lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake</em></p>

<p>I struggled through more of the path, aiming for the campsite where I am now,
I had hoped to push to Viborg today, and even be in Norway in 2 days, but it's
now looking like I am behind schedule.</p>
