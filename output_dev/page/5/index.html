            <p>Me and another cyclist are the only two people on a large campsite 50km from
Vilenus. Coincidentally he has cycled <em>from</em> Tallinn, and is also from Berlin,
but is getting the plane back from Vilenus, and we'll cycle there together
tomorrow.</p>

<p>This morning I woke and didn't feel particularly optimistic about the route
today, there was one major road heading directly to Vilenus, and I believed it
was not legal to cycle on it. It was raining outside, and I made the mistake
of checking the weather, and it was not good for today, or the next day. I
considered staying here for another night, but there was not much to do here,
so I made the decision to move on.</p>

<p>For breakfast I had envisioned using the hotel "kitchen" to prepare some
coffee and make some porridge, but I discovered that they only had a microwave
and a fridge, and not even a sink (all the dirty dishes from the night before
were left for the staff to collect). The hotel did however have a coffee
machine, and I had some chocolates which I had purchased at the supermarket
the night before, so I sat and drank a coffee, and ate chocolate and tried to
plan my route for today.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-09/1.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake</em></p>

<p>This was not easy. There was a single major road heading all the way to
Vilenus (my destination), it didn't seem possible to do it in a single day,
even if I were able to cycle on the major road (and I didn't think it was
legal), so I tried to plan a route using minor roads, but all the minor roads
seemed to head up vertically through the country, and none of them
horizontally, and none of these vertical lines were connected in a coherent
way with even smaller roads, in the end I planned as far as a town, Prienai,
25km to the east and decided to make further decisions when I reached it.</p>

<p>It was already quite late when I left, especially because Lithuania is in
another timezone which is 1 hour ahead of Poland (which is CET). So I also
conceded that I could take a shorter day today, as the total distance to
Vilenus was less than two times my standard daily target of 100km.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-09/2.JPG" alt="Crucifix" /></p>

<p><em>Crucifixion</em></p>

<p>I left the Marijampole, and was soon on the familiar minor gravel roads,
weaving my way from one to the other, and then going through farmer roads. It
had rained, and what was previously insubstantial, inhibiting, sand, was now
puddles of sludge, at one point the road became quite bad. I had to avoid
puddles, and avoid the sloppy sand, and try and find something firm enough to
propel me forward, trial and error. Sometimes riding through the puddles is
better, sometimes not. I rode through one and a good deal of my bike was
submerged and it rose again caked in mud, which did the gears no good at all.</p>

<p>This was slow going, and when I finally got back to the gravel I decided to
try and stick to the roads.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-09/4.JPG" alt="Stuck in the mud" /></p>

<p><em>Stuck in the mud</em></p>

<p>I arrived at Prienai, and was hungry, having only eaten 5 peices of chocolate
for breakfast, in the center I saw a coffee / pastry shop, but feeling more
like eating something savoury, had a look around town, before deciding that
this was the best option and sat down and oreded a coffee and a slice of cake.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-09/3.JPG" alt="Biohazard" /></p>

<p><em>Not sure what this means or if I should be concerned</em></p>

<p>I resumed my puzzled look as I stared at my map and tried to determine how to
ultimatelyt make it to Vilenus, and then where I would spend the night (as it
was clear that I wouldn't make it to the city without doing 20-30k more than I
would normally do). It all lead back to the fact that the major road was the
only sensible option. There was a minor road which looked promising, but it
was cut off by a river, where the only bridge was the major road, or a 20km
detour to the north. Then I considered riding the major road.</p>

<p>I googled, if it was possible to cycle this road, but couldn't find any clear
indiciation, only some advice that "It is perfectly possible to take the A
road from Vilenus to Riga", this made me consider for the first time that it
wasn't illegal to use that road, I then asked the woman at the counter in the
shop, who deferred me to her husband, "Is it OK to ride with bike?" "Yes, of
course, go to Vilenus, just go go go".</p>

<p>I took the road, it wasn't busy at all, there were two lanes, and lorry's
would occasionally pass, and ocasionally not give me much space, but if I
heard or saw them in my mirror, then I could ride into the gravel on the hard
shoulder to let them pass. I was waiting for people to honk their horns at me,
but they didn't, and eventually I saw another touring cyclist ride the other
way, and my confidence that I was allowed to ride this road grew, but  it
wasn't a comfortable road to ride on.</p>

<p>After 20km on this road, I had the option to take a minor road, but it
wouldn't have helped me towards my destination in a good way, so I decided to
carry on for another 25km to a town where a road led off which presented a
viable approach to Vilenus, and then I decided that I could just get a hotel
there, when I arrived there were no hotels, but there were signs for a
campsite, 2km down the road.</p>

<p>I rode into the campsite, and it seemed deserted, eventually I saw some
movement and there was a man sweeping the floor of what looked like an eating
area, I waved, and indicated that I wanted to camp, he seemed agreeable, and
didn;t speak any English, but signed that it was 9 euro, and led me to the
reception, where I paid and signed in - the last entry in the registrar was
from yesterday, I was the only person on the campsite (and it is relatively
large one).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-09/5.JPG" alt="The A Road" /></p>

<p><em>The A Road was not very busy</em></p>

<p>Another cycle tourer entered the campsite. As mentioned at the beginning, he
was also from Berlin and had cycled from Tallinn. We cycled back to town and
got some beers, and talked for a few hours. He's a French teacher, and his
English wasn't as good as his French, and I could speak Frecnch, but my
Geramtn is worse than my French, but not as good as my English, and his
French was better than my French, so we eneded up talking mostly English using
German or French words as required.</p>

<p>I then settled down to write this blog post when the campsite man sat down and
started speaking to me. I had the impression earlier that he was from Ukraine,
and that after I tried speaking my newly lernt Lithuanian phrases to him, that
he possibly didn't understand Lithuanian. This was clarified when I asked him
if he understood in Ukranian using Google Translate. He only spoke Ukranian
(and possible Belarussian) and we passed an hour trying to talk to each other
with no common language.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll ride to Vilenus with the guy from Berlin, and will try and find
a good hostel and have a rest day.</p>

            <p>Loud music was pounding on the street, I thought I would wait until 12, maybe
it would stop, but I fell asleep before that. In the morning I made my way to
the restaurant to see what wonders awaited me. It was a buffet breakfsat, the
guy spoke to me in German and asked if I wanted eggs "Speigel Eier oder Rugh 
Eier" (and yes, I have no clue how to spell or write in German). It wasn't a
particularly good breakfast, what made it not a good breakfast was mainly lack
of real coffee - they only had instant.</p>

<p>The bike was safely stowed, I packed my stuff, and then tried to do some
research on my route today which would take me into Lithuania. I also purged
the Polish lessons on my MP3 player and replaced them with Lithuanian lessons
before packing up and going downstairs to fetch my bike.</p>

<p>There were two other bikes in the storage area when I pulled in yesterday, and
now they had two people handling them. Two women, I asked which city they were
heading two, they said "Kaunas", I said "me too!". But our conversation didn't
proceed any further, and I wasn't even sure where they were from. After
securing my gear I left and overtook them with a wave after 10 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/1.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Road</em></p>

<p>The weather has generally been overclouded for the past days, with intervals
of sunshine. There was more sunshine to start with today, and I wondered that
I hadn't suffered much from the sun so far, I had sun burn on my first days
from wearing a vest, and my lips are cracked (and I have woken up with blood
on them for the past two days), but otherwise I'm good, my feet have been
completely unaffected by the suns rays.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/2.JPG" alt="Water" /></p>

<p><em>Water</em></p>

<p>On the road out of Goldap, I again had the choice of riding the GreenVelo
route -- as I turned onto it I couldn't help but notice that the main road was
far more direct, and that taking the cycle path added another 7-8km. I stopped
and struggled to decide: take the boring main road, get somewhere quickly, or
take the unknown cycle path, which is longer, probably has an awful road, but
would of cource be somewhat safer more interesting. Whenever I'm in doubt, I
choose the hard option, and I'm glad I did, it was certainly slower, but was
much more pleasant, but after 7-10km when it approached the road again, I took
my opportunity to bail and make up some kilometers.</p>

<p>The terrain is getting more hilly, and at one point I was elevated to 300m,
and was offered a panoramic view of the land.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/4.JPG" alt="Panoramic" /></p>

<p><em>Panoramic view</em></p>

<p>I stopped at a shop and got an energy drink, and, not finding any peanut
butter, got some bread and a packet of biscuits, unfortunately I did not have
enough Zslotys for the biscuits, which meant that I had successfully spent all
my Zslotys, and when I cross the border I can go back to Euros.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/3.JPG" alt="Steep" /></p>

<p><em>Normally I associate the gradient signs with a mountain, but what you see is
all of it</em></p>

<p>I crossed the border to Lithuania - there was no border station, just an
sign with "Republic of Lithuania" surrounded by the stars of the European
Union.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/5.JPG" alt="Border" /></p>

<p><em>Crossing the border</em></p>

<p>First impression of Lithuania was that it was full of forest, the road signs
changed their form, and so did the roads.</p>

<p>I tried to initially avoid the "orange" roads, which seemed to be minor
arteries through the country, instead I threaded my way through country roads
- to begin with these were asphault, but soon gave way to devlish gravel.
The roads were wide enough for two cars side by side, and the surface
varied, sometimes it was just sand and my tires would slide, otherwise there
were ruts, as if a tractor had driven over concrete and it had set with the
tread marks - riding over this was bone-shaking - then there were sections
that were packed earth, and which you could ride reasonably smothely over as
long as you could avoid the large rocks scattered around.</p>

<p>Whilst riding over all of this I became concerned about my laptop, which is
sitting in my front panier, completely unprotected. Twice so far I have turned
it on and it was dead, and required a reboot - which might be related to
excessive vibration, so far it is fine, but I am now making an effort to wrap
it up in my hoodie to dampen the vibrations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/6.JPG" alt="Raw road" /></p>

<p><em>Horrible road</em></p>

<p>I did my first two Lithuanian lessons, initially it bore some resemblance to
Polish, but not so much subsequently, although the sentence structure seems to
be the same or similar. Lithianian and Latvian and sibling languages descended
from Baltic-Slavic, and they are, according to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language">the closest living
languages</a> to
proto-Indo-European (which is the common ancestor of most European languages).</p>

<p>So far I have "A-chew" (thanks) and "Ar(rr) youze soren-te-te Engleske" - do you
understand English (untested).</p>

<p>I managed to cover 80k and ride for 5 hours before having lunch. I stopped at
a Lithuanian shop, which resembled very much shops I had visited in Slovenia.
They had lots of buckets of sweets which you could mix and match. I couldn't
find my peanut butter, so just picked up some sweets and some peanuts then
found a bench (after a long passive search) in the next town where I sat down
and put some peanuts in some bread, and washed it down with some chocolate
sweets.</p>

<p>I then continued, it was only 12km north to my preferred destination, I had
quickly researched places to stay on Google, and this place had a campsite, it
also had hotels, but they seemed "expensive" on the google search (i.e. the
cheapest was €30). When I reached the turning to the campsite I checked the
prices again, and realised the last time I had selected "2 Guests", when
selecting "1 Guest" I found the price was actually €15, and decided that fo
r that price I could stay in the hotel.</p>

<p>The hotel was about 1.5k from the center, they charged €20 (I guess I
should have booked) and they don't have breakfast. They do however have a
guest kitchen, and were able to take my clothes to be washed for €2, and I
don't have any worries about the bike, which is stored securely underneath the
stairs.</p>

<p>Lithuania is then cheaper than I thought.</p>

<p>I walked to town for dinner, stopping by a huge supermarket on the way to
checkout what they had, and they had no peanut butter. I then continued the
remaining 1km to the center, at which point it started raining hard and I ran
to the underpass and sheletered as two kids shot past me on their bikes
clearly elated to be getting wet. I couldn't really be too happy about it
though. After the main thrust of the rain stopped, I ventured outside placing
the panier containing my laptop over my head as a makeshift umbrella.</p>

<p>I found a cafe (as it was still to early to have dinner) and ordered a coffee,
and did some laptopping, the cafe also did Pizza, and is evidentally popular
hangout for young people. I got a menu, and was happy to see a dedicated
vegetarian setion in the menu, which is a welcome change from Poland (assuming
this is not exceptional).</p>

<p>On the way back I revisited the supermarket and picked up some mix-and-match
chocolates, some cereal, and two of the many new beers which I have never seen
before, but when checking the clerk said something like "No beers". After
researching it is <a href="https://nordan.org/lithuania-to-raise-legal-drinking-age-shorten-alcohol-selling-hours/">illegal to sell beers after
20:00</a>
in Lithuania - then I was confused because it was only 19:30, further research
led me to the fact that Lithuania is EET (UTC+2), compared to my watch which
is CET (UTC+1). So no beer for me this evening.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-08/7.png" alt="No beers" /></p>

<p><em>No beers after 20:00</em></p>

<p>It is 57k taking major roads to the nearest city, Kaunas, or 120k as the bird
flies to Vilenus - my next major checkpoint, and potentially a place to take a
rest day, but it's unlikely I can do it in a single day on minor roads, so
will investigate further.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The hotel wasn't the best. I didn't sleep well, and was anxious about my
bicycle being in the hallway only demobilised but not locked to anything. I
could hear anybody talking in reception. When I woke, I had no breakfast to
get ready for, so I just packed my bags and checked out. When I asked the
receptionist for water (seeing a basin in the reception) she gave me a litre
of sparking water for free and refused to give me tap water.</p>

<p>The first priority was then breakfast, it was Sunday, and to be honest I
didn't feel very hungry, having eaten a gigantic pizza the evening before, but
coffee was required. I would guess most shops are closed, but the service
stations were open, and I pulled in for a coffee and a muffin and sat inside
and read the news on my phone.</p>

<p>Today looked like a road day - I planned to ride to Ketrzyn then to Gizyco and
then see how much further it was possible to go - there were not many
accomodation options, so it would either be a short day (~80km) or a long one
(~130km).</p>

<p>Riding out of Bartosxyce the road sign said "no cycling" - they do this quite
often, and it means there is an accessible cycle path, which I found. The
cycle path went off road and was part of the GreenVelo route - it seems this
is another cycling infrastructure project sponsered by the European Union, and
today I was almost exclusively on this path.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-07/1.JPG" alt="Taking the cycle path" /></p>

<p><em>Taking the cycle path</em></p>

<p>The cycle path was clearly sign posted, with distances to the next village,
and also the distance to the next rest area (signed as "MOA"), the rest areas
were around every 10-20, and included a shelter and a porta-toilet. I passed
various other touring cyclists on the route.</p>

<p>After inspecting my phone, I could see that there was another route which used
more minor roads or used the cycle path, this route would take me closer to
the border of Kalinngrad Oblast and I would pass through a town with lots of
camping at around 80k, with the possiblity of riding on to Goldap at around
130km. This was about 30km north of my planned route, but it seemed to offer a
good entry into Lithuania.</p>

<p>The route was occasionally asphaulted, but more often it was either a gravel
or dirt road. At one point I missed a turning and went 3km in the wrong
direction, but on the way I was able to take some wildlife photographs, there
were lots of birds and rabbits. The rabbits would dive out of the corn field
onto the path, see me, and then run full speed away up the road. Once the
opposite happened and a rabbit was charging down the road directly at me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-07/2.JPG" alt="Rabbit in the road" /></p>

<p><em>Rabbit in the road, taken from a distance with 30x zoom</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-07/3.JPG" alt="Wrong direction" /></p>

<p><em>Going in the wrong direction</em></p>

<p>At around the 100km mark, it started raining reasonably hard, and I put my
jacket on and I could feel the rain slowly saturating my underpants. The rain
also seemed to make the gravel road less effective, so I either had to slow
down or put more effort in to keep my speed up, I did a little of both.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-07/4.JPG" alt="Tower" /></p>

<p><em>Lots of these, don't know what they were for</em></p>

<p>As mentioned previously, I had two choices, either a short or a long day. When
I arrived at the town which could accomodate me in the former case it was
only 1pm and I had done around 85km - the next town with campsites and hotels
was around 50km away, I had an early start and I figured I could make it to
Goldap by around 4pm.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-07/5.JPG" alt="GreenVelo Signpost" /></p>

<p><em>Detailed information for the cycle path, they also had a phone app</em></p>

<p>When I rode into Goldap I saw a sign "HOTEL" and it didn't look expensive, and
when I pulled up I saw the "GreenVelo" sign and a bicycle symbol, and there
was even a ramp (which could also be for disabled access) up the stairs. Upon
entering a lady approached me and started speaking in either Polish, or
German, or a mixture of the two, so I asked her "Sprechen sie Desutch?" she
did, and directed me immediately to a place where I could safely store my
bike.</p>

<p><em>Typical route for today (before it started raining)</em></p>

<p>This hotel is great, it's 100 Zsloty for the room and 20 for breakfast (about
€29 in total), the room is quiet and there is a large common area with
billiards. When I check in I had a shower then collapsed on the bed and
drifted off to sleep for an hour
- after the rain and 7 hours of cycling I was absolutely exhausted.</p>

<p>I'm now sitting in the restaurant, and have eaten my "dinner" - there was
nothing vegetarian on the menu, and I think what I have just eaten is savoury
crepes with saurkraut - Poland isn't really a vegetarian friendly country.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I should be in Lithuania, which seems to be a little bit more
expensive than Poland, I have probably been spending on average around
€25-€30 a day so far - very mainly on accomodation. I'd rather not spend a
fortune however, so, especially as Lithuania is more expensive I will try and
do more camping.</p>
