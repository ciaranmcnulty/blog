            <h2><a href="/blog/2018/07/20/trelleborg-berlin/">Trelleborg to Berlin</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I am now sitting on my cheap Ikea office chair typing this blog post on my
desk in my apartment in Berlin.</p>

<p>This morning I woke first naturally at 4:30am, and then was woken again by the alarm clock
on my phone at 5am. I raised myself in my sleeping bag and unzipped the panel
which opens onto the "porch" of my tent. I had no muesli today, but had good
bread, and I pasted it with jam and had my coffee and read the one day old news
on my phone (there was no Wifi at the campsite).</p>

<p>I was advised to be at the ferry port at 6:30am for the 7:30am sailing, but I
wanted to be there at 6am to give myself some breathing space. I was only 2km
from the ferry port, and I left the campsite at 5:50am, and arrived at around
6:10am.</p>

<p>I was told that I could wait in "here" in the lounge or outside and at 7am
somebody would "open the gate". I said I would wait outside assuming there was
another lounge, but upon investigation it was just a fence with a gate, and I
returned to the lounge and waited with some other passengers.</p>

<p>A man in a high-vis jacket came in and started ushering people towards the
door, he consulted the girl at the check-in and she pointed at me and he
beckoned me to come too and I was allowed to put my bike on the bus which
drove onto the ferry.</p>

<p>I wasn't 100% sure that I was heading to the correct ferry, as we were driving
towards a ferry with "Sassnitz" written in large letters on its hull, but we
passed it and drove up a ramp towards a ferry with no discernible writing on
the side, but given there were only two sailings I was happy to assume this
was the Rostock ferry.</p>

<p>The bus driver waved me towards the end of the ferry and I free-wheeled my
bike in that direction and another ferry operative made arm gestures towards
the other bikes and I made the same arm gesture back and nodded. There were
several bikes tied to the bars at the front of the car deck. There were no
more "ties" however, so I just parked my bike with the kick-stand and made my
way to the stairs.</p>

<p>After being lost for several minutes in the corridors and car levels I found
my way to some of the passenger lounges. People were already there sleeping on
the floor, some had brought duvets up from their cars. I suppose some people
must have had a very early start or may not have even slept at all. One of the
rooms smelt very badly of sewage, which is a shame as it was the room with the
most comfortable chairs.</p>

<p>People were by this time helping themselves to breakfast, I got myself a
coffee and a chocolate muffin and sat down and worked on my software project
for a while, there was free Wifi, even if it was very slow indeed. I had a
missed (whats-app) call from my mother which I only noticed when I connected
to the Wifi, and I rang her. She was still sleeping, I didn't consider that it
was 6am in England.</p>

<p>I did some reading on the ferry, and dozed a bit and worked a bit. We got into
Rostock at around 13:30, making it a six hour crossing.</p>

<p>I had checked the train times on the internet before leaving the ferry and the
next one was at 14:30, I had an hour to get to the train station, buy a ticket
and get on the train. There was no absolute pressure, as the next was at
16:30, but I'd rather avoid the wait, so I made haste on the 10 ride to
Rostock HBF (train station).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_132119.jpg" alt="Sailing into Rostock" /></p>

<p><em>Sailing into Rostock</em></p>

<p>By the time I had found the ticket office and purchased my tickets (~€35 for
me, ~€5 for the bike) I still had 10 minutes to spare. To access the tracks
there were stairs, or a lift. There was a queue for the lift, a queue of four
bicycles, and it seemed to be one biycle at a time. I queued for a few
minutes, and then lost patience and decided to carry my bike down the stairs.</p>

<p>When I lifted the bike it seemed much lighter then I remember. This may have
been because the water bottles were almost empty, or perhaps somehow I have
become stronger in my arms despite doing all my exercise with my legs, or
perhaps I have left something important and heavy behind - but it was easy
work taking it down and then up the stairs to platform eight where I immediately
saw the bicycle carriage.</p>

<p>There were already several bicycles in the carriage, and I added mine to the
mess. The train was very busy. I took my baggage off and found the next
available seat in the adjacent carriage, where I could just about see my
bike.</p>

<p>I didn't really secure it, as doing so would have made the bikes under mine
somewhat inaccessible and was made nervous when I saw a toddler walking up and
down between the bicycles, and playing with my pedals - the little shit
derailed my chain - but I was more worried about the train going around a
corner and the bicycle falling on him. So I went up to check it was stable,
and it was - and the father of the child said "It doesn't move, it's perfect".</p>

<p>I didn't do much at all in the 3 hour journey in the packed train, more and
more passengers and bicycles kept piling in as we went. As we approached
Berlin there were four different stations, the second was the HBF (central train
station), but the first I didn't recognize. Five minutes before we arrived I
searched on my phone I realised the first would be closer to my flat, so I
hastily collected my four panniers (hanging them around my neck and arms) and
shuffled my way towards the bicycle carriage, displacing people along the way.
There were four bikes piled on top of mine now (which had made it's way to the
back). Fortunately there were people on hand to help me out and as I wheeled
my bike onto the platform the toddler-father handed me the last of my panniers
and smiled "good luck" and I smiled back "Danke".</p>

<p><em>Berlin Gesundbrunner</em></p>

<p>As I exited the station I recognized the place, although I had only been there
once and that was on a run. In short time I was at my building. I almost
forgot about my keys, I had removed them from my key fob and put them in my
handle-bar basket, they were fortunately still there, although they had rusted
somewhat.</p>

<p>I wheeled the bicycle into the corridor and hauled the bags off and heaved
them up the 4 flights of stairs, then went back down for the bike, which was
just in front of the mail boxes. I looked at my mail box and it was packed
absolutely full of junk mail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_174009.jpg" alt="Junk Mail" /></p>

<p><em>My Junk Mail</em></p>

<p>It's probably like this in every city, but the local Netto supermarket sends a
full fucking catalog to every single mailbox every single week, and then there
are miscellaneous other tree crimes, but the catalog is the worst. I had been
meaning to put a "No Junk Mail Please" sign on the box, and decided to do it
now while I had a pen and paper.</p>

<p>After bringing the bike up the stairs I opened the door. I was half expecting
an infestation of fruit-flies. I had mismanaged my garbage and the little
shits had started hatching and I was trying to get rid of them when I left. My
last tactic was to leave several bowls of red-wine around the flat. I'm not
sure if that worked (the red wine had dried out and there were numerous dark
spots, which may have been the flies) but in any case they were all gone (save
one which I found in my shower).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_175126.jpg" alt="Bike in Room" /></p>

<p><em>New Exhibition Piece</em></p>

<p>After depositing my bike, I went to the supermarket and got supplies - bread,
shower gel (I used my last drops the night before), honey, soya-milk, nuts,
other stuff, and a 6-pack of Störtebecker beer (with multiple varieties). I
already had a four-cheese pizza in my freezer.</p>

<p>Being back in the flat is an anti-climax. I was looking forward to being home,
but at the same time I wasn't. Being on the road there is always an aim to
each day - and a larger aim (e.g. get to Trondheim, return to Berlin) and
everything between the start of the day and the end of the day is an adventure
towards that aim.</p>

<p>Being on the road, you kind of forecast your future each day. You decide
that in 2 weeks you will be in this geographic location, and today you might
be somewhere in this area, and you might possibly stay at this place. In
between A and B anything can happen. The only thing that is almost guaranteed
is that you will have exhausted yourself by the days end and feel good about
it, even if, after the seventh hour you felt dreadful and every kilometer
seems like the previous ten. After an arduous day nothing is more satisfying
than well-deserved sleep.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2018/07/19/kungalv-trelleborg/">Kungalv to Trelleborg</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm in a campsite in Trelleborg, the town on the southern coast of Sweden and
the ferry port. I just showered and hand-washed my underwear and shirt which
are now hanging out to dry.</p>

<p>I got out of bed a later today, both because I had relatively late night and
because I was in no hurry, I only had 15km to Gothenburg and then it was a
train and another short ride to Trelleborg. So I had my tent packed up by
around 9:30am.</p>

<p>My neighbours on the tightly packed campsite were a cycling <em>family</em> from
Germany, and an old couple who were touring in their SUV. They had a tent
mounted on the roof rack which opened out and provided shelter by the side of
the car.</p>

<p>The man from the roof-tent SUV approached me and started talking to be in
German, they were heading to the Atlantic Road on the North coast of Norway
west of Trondheim (which I cycled down). We talked about my journey back to
Berlin and he mentioned that there were other options for the Ferry, notably
that there was a ferry to Rostock.</p>

<p>While I was talking I found myself slipping into French, "Ja, ja mais.." "Ja
das ist so, donc errr..". I am reasonably fluent in French, less so in German,
confident in neither. But whenever I speak in another language I always seem
to unconsciously fill in the gaps with French.</p>

<p>I checked this on the Wifi before leaving the campsite, and there was a
sailing at around 15:30. I still hadn't decided on a plan. The trains from
both Rostock and Sassnitz to Berlin stopped at around 22:00, so if I had taken
a later ferry I would have had to have stayed in a hotel, or found a campsite
that would admit me at that time. Hotels in Sassnitz are very expensive (€100+
a night), Rostock would probably have been cheaper but there was also a
campsite in Trelleborg about 2km from the ferry port, so I could also stay the
night and get the early ferry, which would probably be the cheapest option. So
knowing I had some options, I hit the road.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_091648.jpg" alt="Tesla Charging Points" /></p>

<p><em>There are a huge number of Tesla car charging stations in Norway and Sweden</em></p>

<p>Looking back I realised there was a large ruined castle opposite the campsite.</p>

<p>It was plain sailing to Gothenburg, although slightly longer than I expected,
it was around 20k in total. Riding into the city I passed though lots of
industrial areas and construction sites, there was a cycle path all of the
way, although sometimes it was diverted due to the construction works.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_101329.jpg" alt="Crossing the Bridge" /></p>

<p><em>Crossing the Bridge in Gothenburg</em></p>

<p>I didn't stick around and headed straight to the central train station and got
a ticket to Malmo (pronounced "Mal-ma") with the bike. The ticket for <em>me</em> cost
around €60, and the bike another €28 (the same price as a child). When I
bought the ticket the girl behind the counter said that the train left in 10
minutes, which made me think I might miss it, but the ticket was valid for all
trains, so there was no absolute pressure.</p>

<p>As it turned out the train was about a 1 minute walk away and was already at
the station. I pulled my bike onto the first carriage, as there were folding
seats and space for a bike, but I noticed there were no bicycle signs, I asked
a passenger if he spoke English, and then if he knew if this was the correct
place for a bicycle "I have no idea" he said apologetically, hmm. I stood in
open doorway and scanned for a conductor, then noticed a layout plan for the
train in a frame on the wall, it clearly indicated that cycles go in the
middle carriage, so I pulled the bike out and walked further down the platform
and saw a carriage very clearly marked with a bicycle logo.</p>

<p>I pulled my bike inside and there were 3 other bikes already there and a
push-chair. I pulled my bike inside and sat down on one of a row of folding seats
opposite the bicycles. There was a woman and her toddler next to me. As we
pulled away the toddler came up and leaned on my arm, and that embraced it
"Hello" I said. The woman smiled and pulled him away. A few minutes later he
came up again and hugged my leg and of course everybody laughed at how sweet
it was and the woman pulled had to separate him from me.</p>

<p>I was quite tired and dozed off on the train, I read for a little while, and
tried to do some work on my laptop, but was unable to do much as I required
the internet.</p>

<p>It was around 2 hours until we arrived in Malmo. Walking out of the train
station I was greeted by a lively aesthetic square, as I cycled thorugh the
town I reflected on how nice the city was, but I made my way out and rode
straight to Trelleborg.</p>

<p>My optimistic first estimate of the distance was 10, I think I estimated
this a week ago and never revised it, but it was more like 30km. Fortunately
there was a strong tail-wind and I made fast progress, at one point nearly
hitting 40kmph on the flat, a speed that would not impress a racing cyclist,
but on a touring bicycle it's pretty fast.</p>

<p>As I cycled towards the ferry port I passed two youths, one of which spat as I
cycled past and then I could here them jeering behind me. It might have been
my imagination, but it made me angry. I rode on. This is the second time I've
been provoked, the first time was a couple of days ago when a car beeped at me
for no other reason than that I was cycling on the road in a shopping center
car park, after passing me he accelerated his cheap pseudo-sports car in an
aggressive way. Prior to this I had not had any cars beep at me (except a
single lorry and that was justifiable).</p>

<p>I found the ferry port, and went inside and asked about "boats to Germany".
There were sailings today, but they were full. Tomorrow there were sailings to
Sassnirz and Rostock at 07:30 and 07:45 respectively. I booked the 07:45 to
Rostock and decided to make my way to the campsite.</p>

<p>On the way I found a cycle shop. The clerk was in the middle of selling a new
pair of bicycles to an older couple and I had to wait about 10 minutes, but
eventually I got myself a working pump and a new inner tube from the affable
man. I'm not planning to cycle any more long distances before getting back to
Berlin, so probably won't need them, but there is always a chance I will end
up cycling some or all of the way to Berlin if I can't get a train ticket
tomorrow. It's not over until it's over!</p>

<p>The campsite is a pretty large one, and at the reception I payed the highest
price so far, I think it translated to around €20. The shower and kitchen are
included in the price, but there is no Wifi at all. This is annoying, as I am
now unable to (conveniently) further plan for tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_181844.jpg" alt="The Campsite" /></p>

<p><em>The Campsite</em></p>

<p>So I have an early start, I plan to be at the ferry port at around 6am, so
want to get up at around 5am. Will probably get into Rostock at around 11am -
and then the plan is to get the train to Berlin - but bicycle spaces are
limited, so will just play it by ear.</p>

<p>At the very least, I will be glad to be in Germany again, and have use of my
mobile internet, be able to withdraw cash and use my card without surcharges
and return to my normal economy.</p>

            <p>Another troublesome day with the bike.</p>

<p>As I settled down in my tent last night there was a group of four or five
teenagers in the tent next to mine who were talking and laughing until
midnight, and somehow, although they were not being overly loud, managed to
annoy me as I was trying to read. At 4:30am there was a crash of thunder (but
no rain) which woke me up, and I guess most other people on the campsite
including my neighbors, but they were the only ones who decided to chat about
it for half-an-hour.</p>

<p>The temperature is better at night now, probably because I am further south,
but perhaps also owing to the weather. Today was also hot, but with lots of
humidity too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_090719.jpg" alt="133k" /></p>

<p><em>133k (but think this was the motorway distance)</em></p>

<p>Before leaving the campsite I tried to use the internet and investigate a
possible hostel in Gothenburg and check the train and ferry times, but the
connection was awful, and I gave up, deciding instead to head to a campsite in
Kungalv, which is 10 from the city. I'm hoping I will be able to make the
complete jounrey back to Berlin tomorrow - getting the train from Gothenburg
to Malmo, then cycling to Trelleborg to get the ferry - but as yet I still
don't know when the boat sails or how much it will cost.</p>

<p>It was going to be a longish journey, at least 133km, more like 150 to the
city itself, but the terrain is relatively flat, so I was able to make good
time, following the motorway with the minor roads.</p>

<p>I stopped in a Swedish supermarket, the prices seem somewhat cheaper than
Norway, but it's difficult to be sure as I don't know the conversion rate.
Both countries use the term "Krona" but they are different currencies, but I
believe the conversion rate is similar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_103140.jpg" alt="Lumps" /></p>

<p><em>Lumps</em></p>

<p>There was a slightly different selection of food, and I got a small
ready-to-eat garlic baguette and a pastry, a bar of chocolate a can of
beans and an onion.</p>

<p>The sky was stormy and as I approached the city of Uddevala there were gusts
of wind and very dark clouds and the occasional clap of thunder and lightning
and then it started raining, but not very hard. I had covered about 70km when
I sat down for lunch on a bench in the rain.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_093401.jpg" alt="Swedish Milestone" /></p>

<p><em>Swedish Milestone</em></p>

<p>After navigating out of the city, and riding about 10km I had a puncture. The
first puncture of this tour. An inconvenience, but also a coincidence, could
it really be unrelated to the problems I had yesterday?</p>

<p>I pulled up and removed the wheel and the inner tube. I partially inflated the
tube, held it in front of my upper lip and rotated it (the lip is sensitive
enough to detect the escaping air). I couldn't find anything on the outside,
so I inverted it and checked the inside. There was a puncture on the inside
next to the valve.</p>

<p>I soon realized my mistake - when I changed the wheel yesterday, I didn't put
any tape around the inside of the wheel. The wheel is punctuated by holes for
the spokes, and without tape the inner-tube can rub against the metal edges of
the holes. This is how the puncture happened.</p>

<p>I didn't have any tape, but I had a length of material which, while not
surrounding the whole wheel, would cover maybe 30% of it, which might do for
the remainder of the journey.</p>

<p><em>Makeshift Rim-tape</em></p>

<p>The puncture was near the valve, which is unfortunate as it was near a ridge.
I roughed up  area down, applied a repair-patch, held it there for a minute
and then re-inflated the tire and started putting the wheel on. It is an
energy consuming process, so I was more than a bit pissed off when I heard the
air suddenly rushing out as I secured the wheel. Off it came again! I decided
to use my spare inner tube.</p>

<p>The spare inner tube had a different valve, but that was fine because my pump
could be converted to that valve, I went to put some air in it, but the pump
didn't work - the pump was broken. It worked for the "french" valve, but not
the car valve. I couldn't use my spare inner tube.</p>

<p>I tried again to repair the other inner tube, and paid special attention to
try and make it stick as best as possible on the ridge near the valve, I was
pretty sure it wouldn't hold out long, but maybe, maybe it would.</p>

<p>I got the wheel on, and inflated the tire to a reasonable pressure and started
off - if I could get 20km from it, then I could reasonably walk or run the
remaining 20km. But it didn't last 20km, it lasted about 10km. I couldn't fix
it so now I was walking.</p>

<p><em>Grind</em></p>

<p>I walked past a house, and could see some people. The house was actually under
construction and the people I could see were builders, I walked up the drive
way and waved, but they didn't have a pump.</p>

<p>I carried on, it was 5km to the next village, which was an hours walk. I took
off my sandals and put my trainers on and began to jog with the bike, doubling
my speed (at least). I looked around at the houses I passed to see if I could
see anybody, or if I could see a house with bikes outside. There were quite a
few houses, but I didn't want to invest my time walking up drive ways and
knocking on doors only to find that nobody was home or they didn't have a
pump.</p>

<p>Eventually I saw a house with a garage and van outside, and a man was in the
van. I made my way towards him and waved and he waved back.</p>

<p>"Svenska? Engelsk? English?" "English" I replied. "Where are you from?"
"Weymouth" and he looked confused. I thought for some reason that our first
question identified my country not my language. "If you go south from Bristol
to the coast you are there, but I live in Berlin".</p>

<p>I don't think I even mentioned what the problem was before he said with an
Australian twang "You've come to the right place, bring the bike into the
garage"</p>

<p>He walked around and opened the garage doors. It was a large workshop with two
motor-cross motorcycles, loads of tools, a car and a few bikes.
He offered me a shower and even offered to wash my clothes and give me a lift</p>

<p>to the town I was headed to (where he happened to work). He spoke in an
Australian accent and had spent two and half years in Australia, originally
intending to go there for 3 months.</p>

<p>He helped me get the tire off and found some tape to wrap around the inside of
the wheel, and helped me put the tire back on the wheel (I was struggling and
mentioned that sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard, he pointed out
that the tire was not tucked in on the other side, and when that was fixed the
tire fit easily). He offered me a cold, non-alcoholic beer which I accepted</p>

<p>I don't think I could have found a better house to call on. His name was
Daniel and he is a carpenter, mechanic and a motocross champion and was
preparing his bike for a tournament at the weekend.</p>

<p>After finishing my beer I took my leave, it wished me luck with my journey and
I wished him luck with his tournament.</p>

<p>To think, all of the problems I have had over the past two days have been
because of a snapped gear cable and not trimming the end of the replacement.</p>

<p><em>Riding by the motorway</em></p>

<p>I cycled onwards, I still had about 50k to cover. I managed to stay mostly on
quiet roads. Daniel showed me where I could find a bike shop (or a massive
super store that sells just about everything) - I still need to buy a new pump
and a new replacement inner tube. But I decided instead to head straight to
the camping. I have only 10k to do tomorrow, and am feeling confident that the
bike will hold up.</p>

<p>All of this time I thought it was earlier than it was, and was getting to the
campsite at 18:00, I pulled in but couldn't see the reception, so I asked a
man coming out the kitchen - "It's round the front, but I think it may be
closed". I thought that strange, as it was only 18:00. They were not closed
and I went in and asked. A young girl said, "I'm not sure we have room, maybe
you can go and have a look, we have tent places here and here" she pointed on
the map and passed it to me.</p>

<p>There was place, but the campsite is really full. There are a number of dogs
in little corrals attached to caravans. On the way in to the town I passed a
huge field full of tents. All the tents were of the same basic form and
ranked close together, it didn't look like a campsite, I wondered if it were a
refugee camp, but the people didn't look like refugees, and then looking
closer I could see the tents largely contained dogs in cages. And between the
tents were obstacle courses. It was some kind of large dog festival.</p>

<p>So the campsite is full, and there is a dog festival. My watch was on "dual
time" - it was two hours behind. But everything is good. The girl just came in
(at 22:30) and offered me a coffee, as they were pouring the last of it down
the drain. I have been left inside the main reception building in a very
comfortable room (I can leave, but the door is locked for re-entry).</p>

<p>Now, after this blog post I need to find out when the trains leave (although I
think they are hourly) and when the ferry leaves, how much it costs, etc.).
Tomorrow I hope to be in Berlin!</p>

<p>18:00-22:15 ferry to Sassnitz from Trelleborg, 99kr</p>
