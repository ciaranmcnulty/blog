            <p>My bike wheel and derailleur completely destroyed today.</p>

<p>I woke up in the campsite and had 3 helpings of museli and jam and one helping
of coffee, then went to fill my water bottles and wash my pots. I cycled away
in the wrong direction but quickly realised my error and doubled back.</p>

<p>Again, the cycle route was not direct and I just stuck as closely to the
motorway (which goes directly to Gothenburg) as possible. There are minor
roads zig-zagging along side it.</p>

<p>It was only 10km to the border with Sweden and I was soon there. I didn't see
any sign explictly saying "Welcome to Sweden", but there was a bridge crossing
a river which seems to act as the border. Before crossing I went in to a
"Boutik" to try and spend some of my Norwegian kronas, but couldn't really
think of anything to buy - so I just got a loaf of bread and a pastry. I sat
down and ate the pastry, which was dry and disapointing, and I assumed the
same of the bread, but as it turned out the bread was pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_100240.jpg" alt="Bridge over the border" /></p>

<p><em>Bridge Over Bordered Waters</em></p>

<p>So then I was in Sweden, and again I was following the motorway rather than
the cycle route. On my map the road is coloured white - which <em>usually</em> means
that its a very minor country road, but actually it seems to be the old main
road. It was suffering a little from lack of maintainence, and there were
derelict rest areas and abandonned restaurants and shops along the route.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_101824.jpg" alt="Flags Flying" /></p>

<p><em>Flags Flying</em></p>

<p>I made pretty good progress in good time, as most of the terrain was flat,
when the terrain was not flat, I was careful not to strain my gears too much.</p>

<p>At around 12 I started looking for a place to have lunch, but couldn't find
any benches or anywhere to sit down, so I just carried on, aiming to hit the
town I now know is "Tanumshede". On the way I listened to Tom Waits, and was
quietly singing along to the "Rain Dogs".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_123252.jpg" alt="Bjork" /></p>

<p><em>Bjork</em></p>

<p>About 10km from the town, when I was riding up a minor hill, my gears crunched
and then I couldn't pedal anymore. The pedals would not move and a lorry
(which happened to be passing, the road was not busy) beeped at me as I was
somewhat further into the road than I would have like to have been when I
"lost power".</p>

<p>I turned round and manuvoured my bike to the side of the road and had a look.
The problem was that when I changed the cable yesterday, the cable was too
long and I didn't have any wire cutters to remove the end, so I just left it
"sticking out". Somehow this loose end had become entangled in the chain and
run itself into the derailleur, after disentangling the cable the gears were
still not right, and I couldn't figure out <em>why</em>. The derailleur was at a
wrong angle, so I just use brute force and bent it into an angle where the
chain would pass.</p>

<p>This solution worked, it was worse than before, but I could still cycle and I
made it to the town. My mission was still to find somewhere to eat - and it
was <em>really</em> hot, I had already gone through both my water bottles and half of
my 1.5 liter backup bottle. The water in both my bottles was warm. I
eventually (it wasn't easy) found a bench in the town and sat down and had a
can of baked beans and some of the actually quite good bread.</p>

<p>A diverse range of people walked passed me, a pensioner with a walking frame,
an African kid on a bike, a Muslim family and some young kids making strange
noises. This diversity was also very common in Norway, though not, peculiarly,
in Denmark.</p>

<p>I decided to pedal on, and made my way back to the main street and started
cycling down it, I noticed another touring bicycle parked outside a Thai
restaurant, and wondered if it was one of the couples I had already met on my
journey, and then CRACK!</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_145347.jpg" alt="Disaster Wheel" /></p>

<p><em>Catastrophic Bike Failure</em></p>

<p>My chain slipped and there was a crunch of gears and my bike was completely
immobile. I said "SHIT!". I got off and inspected the damage. It was a
disaster. The derailleur itself had bent back and become entangled in the
wheel spokes, and had broken several of them. I stood looking at this mess for
about 5 minutes and it slowly began to realise that I would not be able to fix
this, at least not completely. There was little to no chance I could fix the
derailleur - so my priority was just making the bike mobile again.</p>

<p>I removed the broken spokes, but the wheel would not turn. It was buckled and
the mud guard was obstructing it's rotation. If I removed the mud guard the
wheel might be able to rotate. The mud guard was attached with bolts - and I
didn't have any tool to unscrew them - luckily they were loose and I was able
to unscrew them with my fingers, it was still affixed, more firmly with braces
attached to the forks, which I could not remove, but without the other two
screws the mudguard was loose enough to allow the wheel to pass.</p>

<p>Whilst I was engaged in this, I realised I needed a bike engineer. I asked a
passing woman if she knew of a bike shop "I had a problem with my bike the
other day, and there is a shopping center, I will show you where" ".. and
there is an Intersport there". I thanked her, and when my bike was mobile
again I jogged with it (about 3km) to the shopping center. I didn't dare put
my weight on the wheel and risk buckling it even more.</p>

<p>At the shopping center there was no "Intersport" but there was a "Sport" shop,
I left my bike outside and went in and found the shop, they did indeed sale
bikes, but when I asked if they did repairs "No, we don't do that" "Do you
know a place that does?" "err, yes. You can go to Westmanns, I will show you
where" and I showed me where on my phone.</p>

<p>I jogged then to this shop which was another kilometer or so, I jogged because
it was already around 15:00 and wanted to maximise my chances of having it
fixed today.</p>

<p>"Do you do repairs? Could you fix my bike?" "err, yes, But not today, we have
20 bike repairs queued" I said it was somewhat of an emergency and he said he
would ask the engineer, who came out of the workshop and looked at the bike.</p>

<p>"I have the parts, but I don't have the time to fix it, but there is another
man in town who does bicycle repairs, he has a workshop in his garage" he said
he would ring him for me. He rang, and he rang but there was no answer. He
then said, "well, you could wait here and we could ring again, or this is his
card, he lives only 700m down the road". I decided to visit his house.</p>

<p>When I got there I knew it was the right place because the house had
"Sykelrepairs" (or similar) written above the garage, I rang the door bell and
there was some commotion inside and it was answered by an Asian older woman and a
young girl and an old girl. "Hi!" "Hello!" "Do you speak English" the woman
looked confused and looked towards her youngest daughter (who was maybe 10)
for help, she didn't speak perfect English but communicated enough "She it not
here, she at work" (I think she meant He, his name was Tolbörg) but come back
after 17:00. "Maybe tomorrow?" "No also work tomorrow". I thanked them and
walked back to the bicycle shop.</p>

<p>As I was walking it struck me that I could perform the repair myself if I had
the parts, and I looked at the bike and then at the sprockets then remembered
that I would need to transfer the sprockets onto the new wheel, and I had no
tool to do that (and I didn't even know how), but I could probably fit the
derailleur myself, so I went back to propose a plan "I don't know how
time-intensive it is, but maybe if you could change the sprocket onto a new
wheel I could do the rest myself?". The mechanic didn't look like he thought I
could and was trying to tell me something, but his English wasn't to good.</p>

<p>In the end, he said. If you take the wheel off, then I'll change the sprocket,
then you can change the tire and inner tube and mount the wheel on the bike,
then call me back.</p>

<p>This done, I went to call him, but there were five customers, the guy was
dreadfully busy. When they had left he came out and looked at the bike and
noticed that not only was the derailleur broken (we couldn't tell how) but the
frame (or at least the part of the frame holding the derailleur was bent). He
had a tool to fix it, and he bent it back into shape, but the derailleur still
didn't act correctly (every time it shifted up, it veneered straight into the
spokes again).</p>

<p>He analysed it and tried to figure out how to save it, there was probably some
way to bend it back into shape again. I wonder if the initial problem was the
bent frame, and if I had broken the derailleur by bending it into position, or
if I had bent the frame. But regardless, the guy thought that the derailleur
was savable "Could it be fixed?" "Everything can be fixed, it's just a
question of time and money". We decided to fit a new derailleur. He didn't
have the exact one required, but had something close, he showed it to me and
waited. "So, shall I just fix it on there?" "It will be better if I take the
bike into my workshop". So he did, and I stood and watched him as he nimbly
fitted the new derailleur, and even removed some links on my stretched chain
and did his best to tune the gears: "It's not great, but it's OK. You haven't
got all gears, but you have some."</p>

<p>I was very grateful to him. In the end he probably spent an hour or more of
his time helping me. He charged me for the wheel and the derailleur but
wouldn't charge for his labour. If he hadn't have helped me I'm not sure what
I would have done, but it's likely I would be stuck in the town for at least
another day.</p>

<p>I chucked the destroyed wheel into the skip and cycled onto the towns campsite
(which was just 1km down the road). My bike still needs some looking at - the
mud guards need re-fixing, and the rear break no longer seems to work (though
I don't think it's serious).</p>

<p>The replacement wheel is just a mountain bike wheel, and the derailleur is not
as good as the one it replaced. The back wheel is a slight concern as it has
to hold quite a bit of weight (the older one was purposely heavy and strong),
but I think it will get me to Gothenburg, though not so sure it would survive
a repeat of this tour.</p>

<p>I arrived at the campsite covered in oil. I have no Swedish cash only card,
and asked if I could "buy" some cash, he replied "only for the shower". I
needed a shower "How many showers do you need?" I should have said fifty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_200958.jpg" alt="Pea Soup" /></p>

<p><em>Improved Pea Soup</em></p>

<p><em>PEA SOUP</em>: Before leaving the campsite I took some of my dried peas and put
them in a container with water. They doubled in size and looked like frozen
peas. The aim was to make a thick pea soup - but after 45 minutes of cooking
they were soft enough to eat, but not mushy, and not a creamy soup. But a big
improvement on my last attempt.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The middle aged man on the bunk oppsite to me got out of bed at around 5am, I
woke up and dozed intermitently before getting out of bed at around 7am and
packing my stuff up. I hoped that the hostel had a kitchen where I could make
my breakfast. I went down with my bags and asked at reception "Do you have a
kitchen?" "Only the ones in the rooms". And I thought: fine, I'll go back to the
dormitory where everybody is sleeping and make a full-english then. I'm always
a bit puzzled when hostels put equipment in a dormitory which can only
negatively effect it's purpose: for people to sleep. TVs and bathrooms are bad
enough (people pulling the flush or having a shower at 3am) but I've never
seen a kitchen before.</p>

<p>With the kitchen not being an option, I sat down in the reception and pulled
out some of my camping gear and poured the last of my museli into the camping
pot and added water and jam. I thought I would bolster myself with a last shop
in Norway on the way out of Oslo. I was actually pretty hungry - as I had only
had a sandwich for dinner the previous night.</p>

<p>I packed up my stuff and walked around with my bags to the hotel next door
where my bike was stored. Loaded it up and walked out onto the street and took
check of myself: Both my water bottles were half full, I hadn't been to the
toilet and I was hungry. Not the best way to set out, but I set out anyway and
cycled south, trying to cut into the center of Oslo to have a look about, but
didn't stay long or see anything of particular interest.</p>

<p>The sun was shining and the sky was clear, and it was not cold at all. I
headed to the town of Ski. There is a cycle route to Gothenburg (as found on
the Eurovelo website and on my phone) but it is not at all direct, and looked
very hard to follow. I started by following the route, but was always ready to
hop onto the main road to bypass lengthly, cycle-friendly, detours.</p>

<p>The terrain was refreshingly flat for most of the day.</p>

<p>First stop was a supermarket. I was looking for green-lentils. Actually, I
have been looking for green lentils since the second week in Norway. I had
some from Denmark which lasted me a good while, but perculiarly I cannot find
<em>any</em> in Norway. Well, they have lentils, but they have no <em>dried</em> lentils of
any color. This is a shame as that's basically my protien.</p>

<p>So, I got only another can of baked beans, some bread, a pastry, and, possibly
a mistake, but a bar of choclate.</p>

<p>This was my first bar of chocolate on this tour. I think on my first tour I
ate two or three big bars a day and put on weight. Chocolate is (for me at
least) highly addictive. It is also a good source of energy, as I was feeling
depleted I decided to indulge myself with a €2.50 (the cheapest) bar of
chocolate. I think it helped, but as I was cycling my mind kept thinking of
the bar of chocolate and how I should stop and eat some. I managed to save
enough during the day to have only just finished the last two peices while
writing this blog post. But I will continue to avoid it.</p>

<p>The same goes for cookies (or any high-sugar snacks) - they taste nice and I
can fool myself into thinking I need it, but I will easily demolish a half
pack in a single sitting even if I told myself I would only take one. So
better to abstain. Instead I will by single-serving pastries to get my sugar
hit.</p>

<p>The previous evenining, while I was leading the Bavarian tandem couple to the
hotel, my chain slipped. It wasn't the first time on this trip, but it was a
sign of things to come today.</p>

<p>The slipping chain has a singular effect on me. Everytime it happens I have a
loud bout of tourrets. It is very discouraging, and sometimes dangerous,
especially when cycling up a hill and your putting your full force into the
pedal, when it slips the pedal flies forward and it's possible to lose your
balance, or for the pedal to go 180 degrees and the opposite pedal to hit your
leg. It happens randomly when you least expect it and means that you have to
approach steep inclines in a very cautious way.</p>

<p>The chain continued slipping today, until the gear stopped working altogether
and the chain rested on the bottom rung and wouldn't budge.</p>

<p>A quick investigation revealed that the cable had snapped and I pulled the
frailed end out of the gear changer on the handle bar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-16/IMG_20180716_111541.jpg" alt="Broken Cable" /></p>

<p><em>Broken Cable</em></p>

<p>This happened two years ago in Slovakia, I think on the other side. Then, I
had no replacement cable and it was a Sunday had to tie the cable to the frame
in order to keep the deraileuer in a single position until the following day.</p>

<p>Fortunately I learnt from that and made sure to buy an extra cable. That extra
cable has been sitting at the bottom of my food-bag for two years, it was
rusty but serviceable.</p>

<p>I spent some time figuring out how to get the cable attached to the
gear-changer. In the end I had to partially dismantle it. There is a "meter"
showing which gear you are in, it was on the bottom part of the changer and
hooks into the mechanism on the upper part. So when I dismantled it, it was
very hard to get it back together again, and consequently it doesn't work
anymore, but not a great loss.</p>

<p>The cable was now replaced, but I didn't bother tuning the gears, which in
hindsight would have been energy well invested, but I left thinking I could
tune them if necessary on my lunch stop. But the gears were completely awful,
and I had to apply pressure to the changers some of the time to stop them
slipping.</p>

<p>About this time I passed a group of three young cyclists, two guys and a girl.
These three were to play a repeated part in the days cycling, as, despite me
stopping mulitple times to fix my bike and have lunch we kept passing one
another. It seems we had the same destination. Around the fourth time there
were smiles as they saw me again and I smiled back, the last time I passed
them they were all three sitting in the shade of a cabin, when they looked up
and saw me they all gave me a big wave and I waved back. I then carried on,
but realised that I had taken the wrong direction, so passed them once more
for the last time.</p>

<p>After making my first road-side coffee (I had no coffee in the morning, so I
pulled out my camping stove in a lay-by) I started to tune my gears. To tune
the gears I turned the whole bike upside down, it probably took around 15
minutes, and seemed much better afterwards, at least for an hour or so. During
this hour I was quite happy, much facilitated by the flat terrain and my new
music.</p>

<p>My MP3 player has around 15 albums on it, but I have listened to them too many
times, but then I remembered seeing a micro-sd card in my luggage and wondered
what was on it. I wasn't sure exactly where it was, but searched the possible
locations and eventually found the finger-nail sized memory card. It was at
least two years since it had last been used and initially my MP3 player
wouldn't accept it, but after some vigorous rubbing and blowing it registered
and I found a little treasure-trove of around 20 albums and rode off listening
to Jefferson Airplane and then The Pogues.</p>

<p>But this period of contentness was interuptted when my gears started making a
abbrasive noise and I stopped (I had actually just pulled in beind the three
young cyclists on my route). I looked at the problem. The front deraileuer
was, on the highest rung, was rubbing bother the back and front of the chain.
I didn't know how this was possible, or what could have changed to cause this
strange state. This made me quite sad as the gears were working so well
previously.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-16/IMG_20180716_173108.jpg" alt="Token Picture" /></p>

<p><em>Token Picture</em></p>

<p>I didn't know what had happened, and the only way I could see to fix it was to
rotate the whole deraileur to a different angle so that the chain passed
through it silently.</p>

<p>The chain continues to slip now and then - I assume its related to the tuning,
but it may well be that the chainset is worn down (it's seen almost 10,000km I
guess) and the two problems are just coinciding.</p>

<p>Today I made my target, and am just 10km away from the Swedish border, from
whence the distance to Gothenburg is around 200 - 230km depending on the
route. Looking forward to more flat terrain and maybe some marginally cheaper
prices in Sweden (maybe I can even afford a can of beer).</p>

<p>I have 150kr remaining, which I was saving in case the campsite required cash,
but they only took card (and it cost 165kr in anycase). So will try and
stock-up in a supermarket before Sweden.</p>

            <p>The hostel provided free coffee in the morning and, as hostels often do, free
food. Free food is food left by other guests, and there was a bag of coffee in
the free food cupboard, which I took advantage of when the morning coffee
wasn't available, I also purchased a bag of coffee for the following days, for
it was now the plan to do at least three more days of cycling.</p>

<p>The plan was: Get the train from Trondheim to Oslo, stay in a hostel, cycle
three days to Gothenburg in Sweden, then get the train to Malmo (on the south
coast) where I could get the ferry to Germany, and from there get a trian (or
two) to Berlin. The reason I have to cycle to Gothenburg is that the swedish
trains do not accept bicycles (unless they are packed as luggage). An internet
rumour has it that this is because of "Security Concerns", although what
these are, I cannot guess.</p>

<p>So I had booked the train and the hostel. The train to Oslo cost around €120
including the bike, and the hostel around €35. There is only limited space on
the trains for bikes, and there seems to be a high demand, as there were
multiple trains and the only one availble for me was the one leaving at 15:30.
So I waited in the hostel until around 14:00 then set out for the near-by
train station.</p>

<p>I made a sandwich for later, but decided to buy lunch anyway, the sandwich
would be dinner. There was precious little in the station shop that was
vegetarian, indeed I havn't seen many vegetarian options anywhere in Norway.
At the counter they had three different types of Calzoni, three types of
sandwich, and two types of pannini. The tomato-mozeralla pannini was the only
vegetarian option.</p>

<p>I put my lunch in my bag and made my way to patform four to get the train. I
noticed a large tandem bicycle and an older couple standing by. I said hello,
and asked them about their journey. They were also getting the train to Oslo.
The train had 2 bicycle compartments, it turned out my bike was in the same
compartment as this couple, but there were two other touring bikes going in
another. So this seems like a popular route home for bicycle-tourers.</p>

<p>I loaded my bicycle and sat down in my allocated seat. I got my laptop out and
started working on my project. The train had power outlets but no Wifi, and I
think I spent about 3 and a half hours working, another hour or two reading,
and the rest of the time staring blankly out of the window, and eventually
listenting to an hour of "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich". The train was
slightly delayed and got into Oslo at around 22:45.</p>

<p>Getting out of the train I walked around to the bicycle carridge and waited
for the cycling-couple to extract their tandem from the train with the help of
the conductor. When we were all unloaded and on the platform I asked where
they were staying "The Anker Hotel" the man said. He was a red-faced, grey
bearded, man from Bavraia with his wife. "Me too" I said, "Oh, then do you
know the way there?" "I think so". They were actually sitting 2 seats behind
me and for the last hours they were chanting the directions to the hotel to
themselves "recht, recht, links, zweiter rechts" etc.We decided to go to the
hostel together.</p>

<p>I led the way using my GPS, unfortunately my map had automatically switched to
night-mode, unfortunate because I rely largely on colors to determine where I
can cycle, and now they had all changed. But I just made assumptions and we
cut through a pedestrian square, passing some revelers "Are you doing the
Tour-de-france?". I thought it was obvious that we were not.</p>

<p>The hotel was less than a kilometer from the train station, upon arival we
parked our bikes outside the glass revolving door and the couple checked in
first, the hotel let them and I put our bikes in the baggage room and gave us
receipts. When I checked in they couldn't find my booking, eventually the
young girl looked up and said "Did you perhaps check in at the hostel?", "Yes!
I did!"</p>

<p>The hostel was just the next building down, but run by the same company, so I
was able to keep my bike in the hotel's baggage room.</p>

<p>In the hostel there was a small number of people queuing at reception, a group
of three americans talking to the barman and me waiting to check in. When I
was served they also couldn't find my booking. They asked if I had my booking
confirmation, I showed it to them, but they seemed less concerned that I had
made an incorrect booking, than that their system was wrong. It took ten
minutes for the receptionist to finally concedede defeat "Can you show me the
booking confirmation again?, I will need to create it from scratch, this
system really pisses me off".</p>

<p>In the male-only eight-bed dormitory room there was a middle aged man reading
on the bed, and an Australian sitting on his bed hunched over his phone. I
took a shower. The bathroom was part of the room, and there was also a
mini-kitchen. It wasn't luxurious, and the bathroom sink at pubic hairs in it.
There was no locker to put my stuff in, so I stuffed my bags (all of them)
under my bed and sat down and read. We were soon joined by another man who sat
on his bed and worked on his laptop. Then the Australian started watching a
video on his phone with the sound on. I read a chapter of my book and then
checked if it was OK to turn out the light, and slept pretty well.</p>
