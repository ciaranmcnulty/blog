            <p>The campsite is almost empty and again it's a big one sponsered by the EU.
When I arrived at 18:00 it was empty and I thought it was closed, but I took
the phone number anyway and went to the next campsite on my map 3km down the
road, on arriving there I passed what seemed to be a deer enclosure and there
was a huge stag sitting in the middle of it. There were <em>lots</em> of people at
this place, it seemed like a recreation area, and the campsite was full and I
could hear the "thump thump thump" of club music. I didn't like this, and
thought I would ring the other campsite, someone picked up and said they would
be there in one minute. When I arrived there were already 4 cars in the
parking area, just 20 minutes after I had first arrived. The campsite cost €4
and the guy who was managing it told me there was a shop just around the
corned and I picked up some beers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-12/5.JPG" alt="Stag" /></p>

<p><em>Stag</em></p>

<p>This morning I woke up in the dormitory after a good nights sleep and went
down to the kitchen where the hostel guy was making croissants, and the old
korean was sitting at the table. He complained jokingly that the hostel guy
was chucking him out on the street "He put me out on the street, and old guy
like me" "I found you a room in another hostel!, we are fully booked" "On the
street!" the Korean said with a grin.</p>

<p>I waited for the croissants and Stefan joined and I packed my stuff and said
thanks to the hostel guy, he was a very sympatic man and obvsiously enjoyed
what he was doing, and I think he also ran a bigger hostel in town.</p>

<p>It was good to meet Stefan, who was now going to fly back to Berlin. He is an
experienced cycle tourer, and his first tour was riding across Africa when he
was 19, and has done a dozen since, both alone and with friends. We had
developed many of the same habits with regards to touring, and it was good to
chat, and I expect I'll see him again in Berlin.</p>

<p>Vilnius is quite a big city and it took some time to weave my way out of it
and make my way north. There was a head wind for the first time, although not
very strong, strong enough to contiually rush past my ears and distrurb my
music.</p>

<p>The weather forcast was also good for today, and although the clounds looked
primed to yield rain in the morning, they didn't and it was the sunniest day
for a week, although by far cooler than the first day.</p>

<p>I planned to follow the minor road to Utena - a place where I had assumed I
could find accomodation. I read that it was increasingly popular with tourists
(and the other sobreing thing that Wikipedia said about the town was that
2,000 jews were rounded up and shot uner the Nazis during World War II).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-12/3.JPG" alt="Green" /></p>

<p><em>Green</em></p>

<p>The major A road, was under construction however, so the minor road had much
more traffic initially than I had expected, but as I passed a few junctions
most traffic left the road, and soon it was quiet.</p>

<p>The road didn't go all the way to Utena, and I had to cut across some country
and forest roads. The country side was very peaceful and rich, and there was
the constant sound of Cicadas in the long grass.</p>

<p>For lunch I thought I would stop in the town of Molėtai, and I went to the
supermarket and picked up some bread and a drink, and then carried on looking
for a bench, but I left the town without finding one. About 5km later I found
a lonely bus stop, and had a picnic there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-12/1.JPG" alt="Lunch" /></p>

<p><em>Lunch</em></p>

<p>Arriving in Utena I headed to what I assumed was a "hotel", but when I arrived
it was a guest house, and cost €35 (I didn't speak to anybody, but checked on
the internet). I had assumed there was a hostel here, and failing that some
hotels, but there was nothing, only more expensive guest houses (2 of them).
Looking at the map I saw a campsite 10km further on and left Utena.</p>

<p>So as mentioned at the beginning, it was empty I checked out the other
campsite didn't like it and came back.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-12/4.JPG" alt="The road" /></p>

<p><em>The road</em></p>

<p>Whilst writing this blog post a couple has setup 20m from my tent.</p>

<p>This is likely my last night in Lithuania, depending on if I head north or
north-west, my next checkpoint is the capital of Latvia which is about another
200k from here depending on the route.</p>

<p>My language learning is not going to well, I haven't managed to use anything
I have learnt in the wild, only saying "Achu" occasionally, but then it often
feels better to offer full disclosure and say "Thankyou". Latvia is related to
Lithuanian, but the hostel guy said that they Lithuanians and Latvians could
not understand one another, and the words for "hello", "goodbye" and (I think)
"thankyou" are different, so it will be back to square one.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Today was the first rest day so far. I got out of bed around 8am, and had a
terrible hangover. I went downstairs to the kitchen and sat down, the hostel
guy was there and was preparing croissants, also there was a nice old man from
South Korea. It was good chatting to both of them, the hostel guy worked in
London for 2 years, and actually studied English in my hometown - Weymouth.
This was the first time he had met anybody from Weymouth since.</p>

<p>Korean guy and I ate the croissants, and when Stefan got to the kitchen
they were all gone.</p>

<p>I decided to go for a run to try and beat off my hangover, the hostel guy
recommended running to the "hill of the three crosses" which overlooks the old
town just behind the castle.</p>

<p>I started running, and each pounding step caused pain in my head, but
gradually the head pain disappeared as I started running up the 163m hill. On
top there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Crosses">three crosses</a>
where several Franciscan friars were brutally beheaded.</p>

<p>There were other hills which I ran up and down before running up the river for
a while. After 45 minutes my legs were giving me some problems, and I ended up
walking with a limp for the rest of the day. I have some kind of running
injury in general and probably need to stop running completely for some months
in order to recover.</p>

<p>After the run I collapsed on the bed, before going out to a cafe and getting
coffee and cake and working, then going back and crashing again, then
going out for coffee and cake and working and finally getting lost and
wondering back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Stefan had gone out for a beer when I got back and had invited me along, I met
him and we found a Pizza place and had Pizza beer, I didn't want to
drink more beer however, so went back to the hostel while Stefan ventured out
to some more bars.</p>

<p>It's tempting to stay another day here, but tomorrow I'll leave after the
morning croissants - on my own, as Stefan is flying back to Berlin having
already cycled from Tallinn. There is a EuroVelo cycle route heading to the
capital of Latvia, Riga, which I think will take 3-4 days, then I will have
another rest.</p>

<p>Have enjoyed my stay in old-town Vilnius. Although it's touristy, it is not
saturated with tourists, and there is lots of space and locals seem to be at
least matching the tourist numbers.</p>

            <p>This was the third time camping on this trip, and the third time I had a bad
night, and the third time I had blamed my sleeping mattress. On the previous
tour I had a "full length" air mattress - a self inflating air mattress that
stretched from my head to my feat. This was a perfect mattress, except that it
had developed a micro-puncture, which seems to be undetectable (have held it
underwater for 10s of minutes and no sign of air release), and after 4 hours
of sleep it would deflate and I would wake and not sleep so well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/1.JPG" alt="Stefan" /></p>

<p><em>Stefan</em></p>

<p>Six years ago I had gotten a "half air mattress" which covered the upper body
but left the lower body on the ground -- at the time I remembered it as an
improvement on my situation - it used 1/4 of the space required by a full size
mattress, and, to my memory, was just as comfortable. But now my feet were
cold, and I woke after 3 hours of sleep and was not comfortable at all, and a
mosquito was circling around the interior of my tent periodically buzzing in
my eat until I eventually had the initiative to exterminate it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/0.JPG" alt="Campsite lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake by the campsite</em></p>

<p>In the morning (when was the morning? I woke at 3am 4:30am, 5:30am, 6am. ..)
at 7am I thought it would be a good time to wake, but instead I went back to
sleep which was surprisingly easy, waking again at 8am and peeped out of my
tent into the campsite and saw Stefan sitting on the bench, and offered a cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>I made two coffees and some porridge and read the news on my phone and packed
my tent and we left the campsite and rode down the main rode to Trakai. Trakai
was around 25km from the campsite, and from Trakai it was aroudn 25hm to
Vilnius, and from Trokai we could leave the main road onto a minor road, and
in Torkai we could see the most photographed castle in all of Lithuania -
the Trokai Castle. We saw the castle and took a photo of it without crossing
it's moat and went back for coffee.</p>

<p>At the coffee place there were a group of motorcyclists and Stefan asked if I
understood the language they were speaking, when I paid attention it was a
"strange" dialect of German. The south-germans were talkative.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/2.JPG" alt="Castle and tourists" /></p>

<p><em>Castle and tourists</em></p>

<p>We ordered coffee and pasties (the same as in England, crispy hot pastry with
various fillings) and it started raining and I started looking at the internet
for good options for a hostel for the night, Stefan had originally planed to
stay at the campsite, but decided to give the hostel a chance.</p>

<p>There was no cycling infrastructure entering the city, we had to ride on the
bust dual-carriage way, or ride on the pavement, but were able to find a road
leading directly to the hostel.</p>

<p>On the way the sky started spitting rain drops, and from the previous days we
both knew that this predicted a heavy down pour in around 5 miunutes, I was
happy to get wet, wearing only quick-drying clothes and sandals, but Stefan
was wearing his only shoes, trainers, which would not dry quickly. We made our
way back to the shelter of a door in front of a business enterance in a
parking lot, after standing there for 10 minutes a lady came out and asked
simply "Coffee?". I turned around and said "No, it's stopped raining and I
think we can be going now". In retrospect it would have been better to have
accepted, but on leaving we said thankyou for the offer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/5.JPG" alt="Vilnius and rain" /></p>

<p><em>Vilnius and rain</em></p>

<p>We were looking for the hostel "Hostelgate", and I the hostel was clearly
marked on my map, and we cycled towards it, and then past it, and the got
confused and then went back. Stefan noticed that there was a door with
"hostel" on the doorbell, but it wasn't Hostelgate, he buzzed and a man
answered and said he would come down and meet us.</p>

<p>The guy was friendly and offered to show us the hostel, we bought the bikes
inside the premises and the hostel was clean and good, it small. I had
originally checked "Hotelgate" hostel, but it turns out my map was
out-of-date, and that the hostel had moved two years ago, and this hostel was
subsequently a guest-house, and recently converted back to a hostel, in
anycase it's a good hostel.</p>

<p>After taking as shower and dozing on the bed for an hour we went for a walk in
the town, and I went to the museum while Stefan went to the castle and we
would meet back at the hostel later.</p>

<p>The museum was huge - there are four "tours", each which can be purchased
separately for €3, I got the whole set for €7 and started the first tour at
4pm. The first tour was the history of Lithuania from the perspective of the
ruling classes from pre-historic times to modern.  The tour lead onto an
air-conditioned interior exhibition of an actual archaeological excavation,
with glass paned, raised, walkways leading through the ruins of the destroyed
castle. I spent 2 hours walking around tour 1 before closing at 6pm, and I can
still use the ticket to visit the other 3 tours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/4.JPG" alt="Bell tower" /></p>

<p><em>Bell tower</em></p>

<p>As I was leaving the museum I got a text message from Stefan, from an hour
back, saying that for some reason we had each-others keys for the padlocks to
our lockers. When I got back to the hostel we went out to get something to
eat, eventually ending up in the place the hostel guy had recommend, they
didn't have much in the way of vegetarian food, and I had a "traditional cold
beetroot soup" followed by "4 potato pancakes with mayonnaise", then we had
several more beers.</p>

<p>On returning to the hostel, we met the other two inhabitants of our 4 bed room
who were from Brazil, one of which was a geologist and presented his theory on
why there was so much bloody sand in northern Poland and Lithuania.</p>

<p>And now it is 2:45am and I still need to upload the photos and publish this
blog post.</p>
