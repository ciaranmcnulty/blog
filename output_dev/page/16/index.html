            <p>I was undecided as to whether I would stay another night at the campsite. It
was a friendly, trusting, campsite and they had an area where I could work and
it was a good place for running, but I also knew I couldn't spend any time in
my tent. I was woken up to an already too-hot-for-comfort tent, the sun was
scorching it, and I decided to leave.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-01/IMG_20180701_121244.jpg" alt="The Path" /></p>

<p><em>The Path</em></p>

<p>Initially I noticed that my leg was stiff from the 11 hours of cycling
yesterday, but when I got back on the bike all was fine and I continued to
follow the cycle path after updating this blog and paying for the camping
(100kr - about €10).</p>

<p>I started the day with music before switching to Norwegian lessons. I did 2 or
3 today and am on lesson 9 now. It shares with German and English and throws
in some more stuff. The accent and delivery sound like how people from Wales
speak (to my ears). The word for two is "two" but the word for one is "et".
Lots of the words seem one step away from the English version.</p>

<p>In general really liking the language so far, although it, like German, has
three genders, it otherwise <em>seems</em> quite simple so far.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-01/IMG_20180701_121802.jpg" alt="Corridor of Rock" /></p>

<p><em>Corridor of Rock</em></p>

<p>The cycle path took me across some rugged terrain during the morning, another
"old road" through the country. I passed hikers and cyclists and nodded
"hallo" and "hi". I sat down for lunch in a picturesque spot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-01/IMG_20180701_130635.jpg" alt="Lunch" /></p>

<p><em>Lunch</em></p>

<p>I was cycling down one of the steep inclines and I could see it going back up
like a wall at the bottom and I could see two cyclists walking their bicycles
down carefully. I tried to cycle up the incline, but it takes me an awful lot
of concentration and I can't multi-task. So when I nod to people or
acknowledge their presence in anyway while I'm cranking up a hill I almost
inevitably end up running the wheel the wrong way and stopping. The best thing
to do would be to ignore the people and concentrate on the climb, but that's
rude. I suppose I could stop at the bottom and shout up hello and announce my
intentions before starting.</p>

<p>I lost control when I nodded at the woman walking her bike down the hill and
she said she wanted to take a picture of me "Do you want me to hold your
bike?" "No, I want to take a picture of you" "OK" I said, as I gingerly span
my pedal back round and announced "it's not so easy to start once you've
stopped" I jumped on and managed to grind up the remainder of the hill the
woman shouted "Bravo!" and I raised my hand in victory and fell off.</p>

<p>I didn't really fall off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-01/IMG_20180701_130148.jpg" alt="Rocky Terrain" /></p>

<p><em>Rocky Terrain</em></p>

<p>Eventually I left the trail by way of a colourful garden nursery and I had to
decide where I was actually going today.</p>

<p>There was a campsite on the coast, and the city Stavinger inland. I discovered
that there was a HI Hostel very near the city and it cost only €27 per night
for a dorm (as opposed to ~€80 minimum you can expect to pay for a hotel) and
I decided this could be a good time to take a rest day and do some bike
maintenance.</p>

<p>The bike has nothing <em>new</em> wrong with it, but as I've been riding it,
especially in the steep terrain, I notice that the gears are not calibrated
properly, to switch up to my highest gear I need to switch down on the front
and then switch back up to the middle in order that the chain is not de-railed
(which happens at least twice a day).</p>

<p>Also my chain is dry (I forgot the lubricant) and the new breaks I put on have
given way a little (probably due to me <em>fixing</em> the front bag's bracket, which
was too low and caused the bag to rest on the brake cables making them tighter
than they should have been).</p>

<p>I broke off the path and started along the main road on a direct line to
Stavanger. I was making good time as the wind was behind me and the terrain
was flat, but it was a little disturbing when I could see beast lorries coming
up behind me at speed.  I eventually rejoined the cycle path and rode through
10s of kilometers of boring suburbs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-01/IMG_20180701_151859.jpg" alt="Flat Terrain" /></p>

<p><em>It's flat now</em></p>

<p>At around 80 I was exhausted, and as I closed in on my target a tendon in
my right leg was causing me some minor trouble. But I pushed on, wishing that
I was there already and never really felt closer to my destination until I
arrived.</p>

<p>The hostel is quite good, the staff are friendly. I am sharing a room with a
Korean called Joe (I think, I havn't asked him where he is from) and there is
a Korean (again, I <em>think</em>) family staying here too, and also heard at least
one American. There is a piano in the main room which I might play if there is
nobody around tomorrow.</p>

<p>Half of the hostel are now sitting in front of the television watching
something called football.</p>

<p>It is now almost 11pm, it is still light and I got into the campsite about 30
minutes ago. It has been an extremely long and beautiful day, even if I
couldn't find a suitable place to do wild camping.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_100545.jpg" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake</em></p>

<p>I left the campsite at 8am without thinking too much about where I was going
to stay. I followed the EV1 up until the point where I noticed there was a way
to avoid the coast section (which just went out and back-in again) and cut
straight over the land to rejoin the cycle path.</p>

<p>The night before I had downloaded Norwegian lessons, and I was doing these as
I climbed the closest thing to a mountain yet. I think the highest I have been
so far is around 300m but you are always starting from sea level, and this
climb took a while.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_105458.jpg" alt="Bike and Fjord" /></p>

<p><em>Bike and Fjord</em></p>

<p>Whilst I was climbing I saw two cyclists coming down the hill at speed. They
had paired up and a young guy was hunched down while an older guy was stood up
(in his slipstream I guess). They had racing numbers. I nodded at them, but
unsurprisingly they didn't take any notice as they hurtled down the hill at
top speed. Then more came, and more.</p>

<p>Nodding at fellow cyclists is a strange game, you don't want to nod and be
ignored, but you don't want to be nodded <em>at</em> and not nod back. The only way
to win if you both nod. Sometimes it's obvious, especially with cycle tourers,
there will usually be a big wave and grin.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_150741.jpg" alt="Another Fjord" /></p>

<p><em>Another Fjord</em></p>

<p>There were lots of cyclists spread out, and eventually I broke out of their
circuit.</p>

<p>The landscape was wonderful and reminded me very much of being in the Alps.
There were many lakes and the climbs today were usually long climbs. I much
prefer long climbs to short ones. I don't care if it's 1 hour of 4. You get
into the pace of it, I prefer ascending to descending. It's less dangerous.</p>

<p>After this first cut-over-land I was into the next Fjord and I encountered
cycling pair, they were Norwegian and from a town near Oslo. They warned me
about the steep path up ahead, and I told them about the way that I had come.
I asked them if there was camping in Fekkefjord (the next town) they said
there was, we wished each other happy journeys and went our separate ways.</p>

<p>So this is where my day got interesting. I had already clocked up 70km in 6
hours. I wanted to do 100km, but not if it meant cycling, for example, 140km.
Which is what I did.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_150800.jpg" alt="Another Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Another Lake</em></p>

<p>The couple were right, the way ahead was incredibly steep and gravelly. It was
actually an old road built in 1830s abandoned in the 1920s and I drank a beer at the
"stopping stone" a huge rock by the side of the road which had been used as a
resting place, there were engravings/graffiti of the type "I was here" on the
rock, and some of them pre-date the road from the 1700s.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_153530.jpg" alt="Information about the old road" /></p>

<p><em>The resting rock and a sketch of the old road</em></p>

<p>When I got into Fekkefjord I realised I had already passed the campsite that
the couple mentioned. It was 5km back, the next campsite was 40km ahead, over
mountains. I decided better to go back, but as I was cycling I remembered the
trouble I had with the steep path, and decided, bah "I'll carry on and if I
run out of time I will do wild camping".</p>

<p>Up until this point time had passed incredibly quickly. The first time I had
checked my bike clock, 1 hour 20 minutes had passed, the second time, 4 hours.
Riding the "mountains" is an absorbing task.</p>

<p>I encountered my first "long" tunnel. This one was 770m long and I could see
the light at the other end of it. When a car entered the other side you could
hear the reverberations growing louder and louder until they peaked at the
point that the car was about to pass you, it sounded like waves crashing on
the shore and was incredibly loud (and somewhat frightening).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_135017.jpg" alt="Tunnel" /></p>

<p><em>The long(ish) tunnel</em></p>

<p>But now it was a more and more exhausting one and I was gradually beginning
to accept that I would need to find a wild camping spot. But I found this to
be quite difficult. Most of the terrain is inaccessible to the bike, and the
few places I did find were close to the road, or the ground was too hard (well
rock).</p>

<p>I went on and on, I rode into one Fjord which was the scene of the first World
War 1 battle in Norway as I climbed my way back out of it there were tunnels,
and a cycle path along side the tunnels, which was presumably the old road. I
thought, hmm, maybe I could stay <em>here</em>. But as I rounded the corner I saw
three hammocks blocking my way, and a family sitting at the picnic table (it
was a rest area) eating and listening to music. A little girl was ordered to
come and take the hammock down and help me through I said "Hi!" and carried
on.</p>

<p>There was little chance I would have stayed, but seeing the family there (I
had assumed wrongly that they were cycling) I wanted to ask if I could join
them, I'm glad I didn't as they had driven up and it seemed to be a family
occasion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-30/IMG_20180630_182903.jpg" alt="Road and Water" /></p>

<p><em>Road and Water</em></p>

<p>So now I had ridden for about 10 hours, it was 9 o'clock and it occurred to me
that I'd prefer it not to be dark (incidentally it is now 11:30 and it is
<em>still not dark</em>). I then noticed that I was close to the campsite I had
planned to stay at, but it was 5km off the road, I rang them, no answer. I
didn't want to take my chances with 5 unnecessary kilometers, so I carried on.</p>

<p>I saw the sign to another campsite (actually the one I had targeted this
morning, without realising how tough the road would be). It was now 21:30 and
I knew the reception would probably be closed, but thought I might be able to
catch somebody there, or just pitch my tent and pay in the morning.</p>

<p>There was nobody at reception as expected, I waited around, pressed a button
or two, and then wrote a note before walking into the campsite. I asked the
first couple I met and soon their neighbors, 2 girlds, offered to phone the
owner and I was officially blessed.</p>

<p>I just spoke to the girls who helped me out when I got in, they said they were
here today and tomorrow and they came to see the "Dick Rock". I checked
myself, maybe it was a Norwegian word, I looked at her for clarification: "..
it's shaped like a Penis you see, so we came to see it, a girly trip".</p>

<p>Another good nights sleep and I augmented my breakfast once again, this time
with chocolate milk - Muesli, jam, chocolate milk and coffee. I set out to
follow what officially seems to be the
<a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-12">EV12</a> but is marked on
signs and on my phone as
<a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-1">EV1</a>.</p>

<p>I was soon confused having arrived at a closed pedestrian/cycle bridge and
yet all the while seeing people cycling accross it - where were the going? I
wondered. Following them I found the ingress and the cycle path followed the
highway out of the city.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_120037.jpg"/></p>

<p>The sun was shining again, but not as fiercely as the previous days, and the
cycle path diverged from the highway and followed an incredibly peaceful road
and I cycled for about 3 hours letting my mind wonder and observing the
Norwegian landscape.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was the houses - they are majority of them seem to
be made of wood, with either long vertical or horizontal planks, and often
painted white or red.</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_121619.jpg"/></p>

<p>Then of course there is the rugged landscape, riding along the coast there are
huge slabs of rock and ample forest. With the wooden houses dotted around,
sometimes 4 clustered in a small valley.</p>

<p>The time is really flying by now. I've done 2 hours before I'm aware of it.
Today I did almost 8.</p>

<p>I stopped at a supermarket, the first I had seen in hours, and was at first
deterred by the business of the place, hundreds of parked cars and people
everywhere (it was a group of supermarket-type shops). But outside my market
was a group of salespeople trying (as I found out) to sell cheaper electricity
to people leaving the shop, so I figured they would notice if anybody tried to
ransack my bike.</p>

<p>Inside I got more muesli, a couple of bananas, a loaf of bread and a can of
beer. I got one of the "cheaper" <em>cans</em> of beer, and it cost around €2.15, and
this was a discount market. I think the cheapest one (I found) in Denmark was
about €1.80. In total my shopping cost around €8.</p>

<p>Realising I had forgotten to buy Pasta, I stopped again a few kilometers
further on at a shop next to a lake and got the pasta and a cheap sugary
vanilla pastry. Paying with cash was confusing as I now have a mixture of
Danish and Norwegian kroner, and I had to ask the cashier to sort them for me.
I then sat on a picnic table outside in the sun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_155427.jpg" alt="Is this a Fjord" /></p>

<p><em>A Fjord, I think</em></p>

<p>A couple of sections were very tough. At one point the cycle path continued
from a perfectly good road up a very steep gravel incline and I wondered if
somebody was joking. I checked my map, and that was indeed the path, so I
clicked down (up?) to my highest gear and started grinding away. This was
around 3 of rough and steep up and down.</p>

<p>Near the end of this section I spied another cyclist heading my way, I could
see a small flag flying behind him. He approached with a friendly smile and we
both stopped and he talked to me in Norwegian and then in English, he asked
where I was going, where I'm from and so on, then told me about his journey.</p>

<p>He has been travelling the coast for 4 months. Starting on the border of Russia above
Finland (he was Finish). First of all he skied, then he used a kayak and now
he is cycling, I looked confused and looked at his bicycle - "Oh, I have a
car" he said. So I guessed he was travelling sections then taking the train
back to his car. He was now on his last leg to Kristiansand where he would get
the train back home.</p>

<p>The last challenge of the day was the first "mountain" of the journey.
Although it was only 260m of altitude (less depending on how high I started)
it was a very steep and long climb. I was ascending at the speed of about
4kmph for stretches of it and rarely rose above 7 with sweat pouring from my
body.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_170213.jpg" alt="The summit" /></p>

<p><em>The top</em></p>

<p>After this I decided to stop a bit earlier than anticipated as I had already
done 110km. It was a choice between two campsites, one called "Bibelcamp"
located on the coast, and the other somewhat inland. I choose "Biblecamp"
which I thought might be a christian indoctrination center, but I can't see
any religious symbols anywhere.</p>

<p>It cost only €10 and I have now eaten (lentils and pasta again) and am sitting
under the eaves of the main building with my plugged in to an out-of-door
socket. My powerpack is running a bit low, might see if I can leave it
charging in reception overnight.</p>
