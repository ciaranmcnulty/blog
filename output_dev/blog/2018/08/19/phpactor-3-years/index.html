<p>The first commit in <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor">Phpactor</a>
(pronounced "factor") dates from almost three years ago:</p>

<pre><code>commit 3677c5cb58a5b203fb658c8e2498e512cdef555a
Author: dantleech &lt;dan.t.leech@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Sep 24 14:08:35 2015 +0200

    Initial
</code></pre>

<p>I had no idea about how to create such an ambitious project in a domain in
which I knew nothing. But I had been using VIM for around 7 years (?), VIM is a
great text editor, but the tooling around <strong>refactoring and auto-completion</strong> for
PHP was sub-optimal, and instead of waiting more years, I decided to write my
own tool.</p>

<p>Actually almost all Phpactor development has happened in the past
<strong>year-and-a-half</strong>. The above commit was the first of three attempts to create a
code-completion and refactoring tool backend for editors such as VIM. This
initial (3 commit) effort was to use an SQLite database to index the classes
and functions in a project (an approach that was later dropped). Then followed
another few commits four months later, then more 6 months after that. More
serious development started in late 2016 but I struggled with the
<a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PhpParser</a>, I then found out about the
Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tolerant-php-parser">Tolerant PHP
Parser</a> which was designed
exactly for Phpactor's use case, I also decided to take a more pragmatic
approach to the project.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-19/phpactor.png" alt="The Phpactor logo" /></p>

<p><em>The Phpactor logo</em></p>

<p>What single thing would deliver the most value to <em>me</em>, what would provide the
biggest return-on-investment?</p>

<p>Completion would have been nice, but the one thing that I wanted the most was
a way to <em>move classes</em> - this has been an extremely painful thing to do in
VIM, requiring not only moving files, but also updating all of the class
namespaces, and all the references to those classes.</p>

<p>I decided to concentrate on this single feature instead of trying to
solve the much more difficult problem of code completion. I would just do <em>whatever
was necessary</em> to make class moving work, in a separate, fully
decoupled, stand-alone library. It wouldn't matter if the code was
sub-optimal as it wouldn't contaminate other areas of the application. With
this in mind I restarted the project:</p>

<pre><code>commit 07a8bbb442966854bc6029e7e8490b151366e69a
Author: dantleech &lt;dan.t.leech@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Mon Jun 19 14:47:32 2017 +0100

    Restarting the project
</code></pre>

<p>From this point on Phpactor has just continued to grow and it slowly aggregated
more and more functionality spread out over different repositories. The class
moving library has basically remained the same since it's creation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-19/param_completion.gif" alt="Parameter Completion" /></p>

<p><em>Parameter Completion</em></p>

<p>The origins of Phpactor can be found in some humble VIM plugins I wrote, one which
<a href="https://github.com/dantleech/vim-phpnamespace">determines the namespace of the current class
file</a> and another which
<a href="https://github.com/dantleech/vim-phpunit">generates</a> a PHPUnit test case for
the current class. Both of these plugins made use of the
<a href="https://getcomposer.org">composer</a> autoloader to determine class locations.
This non-standard use of the composer autoloader is what powers Phpactor's
source-location abilities, making slow indexing processes and caching
largely unnecessary.</p>

<p>The current version of Phpactor is something of an epic project. It has many
libraries (for example <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/worse-reflection">worse
reflection</a>, <code>code-transform</code>,
<code>code-builder</code>, <code>docblock</code>, <code>class-mover</code>, <code>completion</code>, <code>path-finder</code>, and
more). All of the libraries are untagged and unstable, none of them are
intended to be consumed by other projects at this point in time and most of
them fall short of being outstanding, providing only what is good-enough for
the Phpactor project. They are, however decoupled from the main Phpactor
application.</p>

<p><em>Some of Phpactors Components</em></p>

<h2 id="an-opportunity-to-experiment">An Opportunity to Experiment</h2>

<p>One of the advantages of personal projects is that you have freedom to
experiment with new ways of doing things, while at work this can either be
risky, or inappropriate.</p>

<p>In writing this project I wanted to try some of the DDD concepts I
discovered after reading Vaughn Vernons <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing Domain-Driven
Design</a>.
Implementing a new paradigm is always going to be a trail-and-error
experience, and I would do some things differently next time. All the
libraries in Phpactor have a directory structure similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">lib/
    Core/
        ...
    Adapter/
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>With all the "clean" uncoupled code in <code>Core</code> (I was going to call this
<code>Domain</code>, but didn't want to presume that I was doing DDD) and the
adapter which implement the interfaces in <code>Core</code> and provide a coupling to
another library. In an ideal world these adapters would be in separate
packages, but the value wouldn't outweigh the effort in this case (or at least at
this moment in time). I also implemented many <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value
Objects</a> (VOs).</p>

<p>There is an amount of VO duplication between packages, notably for things such
as <code>SourceCode</code> and <code>ClassName</code> objects. It might make sense in the future to
extract some of the VO objects to a separate packages, but it's difficult to
determine if the meaning is exactly the same (e.g. a <code>ClassName</code> VO in a
library which infers <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/class-to-file">class names from
filenames</a> has different
requirements than a <code>ClassName</code> in the reflection library), however
<code>SourceCode</code> is implemented three or four times as basically the same class.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-19/extract_method.gif" alt="Extract Method" /></p>

<p><em>Extract Method</em></p>

<p>I also learnt to avoid expose value objects at package boundaries as arguments.
Exposing them meant that code outside the package would know more about the
package than it ought to have done (for example, it imported the class name, or
used a specific method of the VO) and therefore increased the difficulty and
risk of refactoring the package.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="php">use Phpactor\\ClassToFile\\Core\\ClassName as ClassToFileClassName;
use Phpactor\\WorseReflection\\Core\\ClassName as ReflectionClassName;

$file = $classToFile-&gt;classToFile(ClassToFileClassName::fromString('Foobar\\Barfoo'));
$reflection = $reflector-&gt;reflectClass(ReflectionClassName::fromString('Foobar\\Barfoo'));
</code></pre>

<p>and without the VO:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$file = $classToFile-&gt;classToFile('Foobar\\Barfoo');
$reflection = $reflector-&gt;reflectClass('Foobar\\Barfoo');
</code></pre>

<p>Internally the package could still use the VO but this detail is hidden
from the outside.</p>

<h2 id="wheel-reinventing">Wheel Reinventing</h2>

<p>The wheel has been reinvented a few times, notably in the case of
<a href="https://github.com/phpactor/worse-reflection">WorseReflection</a> (WR) - the
backbone of Phpactor. It provides broadly the same functionality as, and was
influenced by, <a href="https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection">BetterReflection</a>
(BR) with the addition of type and value flow (required for completion). The
justification here is that it would have been impossible to merge the
type-flow code in WR into BR, because it was so bad and experimental. But
whilst being experimental it was providing actual value to Phpactor. In
addition, BR had some performance problems (at the time) which made it
specifically unsuitable for real-time completion.</p>

<p>On one hand it is a shame that I didn't contribute to BetterReflection, but
on the other I don't think Phpactor would have been built if I did. WR is the
core domain, and as such it is subservient to the needs of the project and
needs to be owned by it.</p>

<p>Another example of wheel-reinventing is the <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/docblock">docblock
parser</a>. There is already the <a href="https://github.com/phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock">PHPDoc
DocBlock</a> and the great
<a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpdoc-parser">PHPStan PHPDoc Parser</a>. The first
project depended on the <code>nikic/php-parser</code> for type resolution (which is
arguably not a requirement for a parser). The PHPStan parser was functionally
perfect, and I happily tried to <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/worse-reflection/pull/28">replace the Phpactor
parser</a> - but 
unfortunately it was 10x slower than dumb regex parsing, so the otherwise
inferior Phpactor package is still relevant.  It's the difference between a
0.25s completion time on a PHPUnit test case, and a 2.5s one.</p>

<p>Finally there is Phpactor's <a href="https://phpactor.github.io/phpactor/rpc.html">RPC
protocol</a> used to talk to the editor. At the
time I was vaguely aware of <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/gh-pages/specification.md">Langauge Server
Protocol</a>
(LSP) but didn't look more into it as it is for a language <em>server</em>. Phpactor is not
a server, it's invoked as a command. In hindsight the RPC protocol of Phpactor
can fit inside the LSP and Phpactor could optionally be made
into a server (although running as a short-lived process is better in terms of
stability) (see pull
<a href="https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/pull/531">request</a>). LSP support would
allow Phpactor to be used transparently by many more editors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-19/import_and_implement.gif" alt="Implement Contract" /></p>

<p><em>Import class and Implement Contract</em></p>

<h2 id="return-on-investment">Return on Investment</h2>

<p>Phpactor has taken up a <em>huge</em> amount of my spare time over the past
year-and-a-half. I enjoy coding and look forward to spending a Saturday
morning crafting a new feature in Phpactor, but often morning becomes
mid-afternoon, and sometimes intrudes into Sunday.</p>

<p>Personally Phpactor is now an indispensable tool that I use at work every day,
and I am most motivated to work on it when I am presented with a particular
challenge in my job.</p>

<p>But I do ask myself if it is worth the time given that there are other
projects which have grown in Phpactors lifetime (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server">Php Language
Server</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/padawan-php/padawan.vim">Padawan</a>) but these two libraries
are mostly (exclusively?) concerned with code-completion, I don't think there
is anything freely available which competes directly with Phpactor.</p>

<p>But still - is it worth me <em>investing all this time</em> when I could be working on
other projects? (like my other side-project,
<a href="https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench">Phpbench</a>, which has seen little
attention since I started Phpactor) -- or -- doing things <em>other</em>
than programming?</p>

<p>This is a question I ask myself sometimes, and to be honest, all things
considered, it probably isn't worth it. But I am happy that Phpactor turns VIM
into viable modern IDE for PHP and it can now handle finding method references
for example, and provide some relief to users of other editors
working with VIM users:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Think I might start charging to be a PhpStorm by proxy for VIM users that can&#39;t find occurrences of method usages and the likes :)</p>&mdash; James Titcumb 🇪🇺 (@asgrim) <a href="https://twitter.com/asgrim/status/1011267764659638277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">25 June 2018</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I was slightly surprised to notice when I paired with a developer using PHPStorm we both
look for references to a particular method, both PHPStorm and Phpactor returned
the same methods and, when finding class references, Phpactor
actually seemed to have out-performed PHPStorm. I do not assert that Phpactor
is as accurate or comprehensive as PHPStorm (because it is not), but it does a
pretty good job.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-08-19/class_references.gif" alt="Class References" /></p>

<p><em>Class References</em></p>

<p>Finally, there is more interaction with other people in the Phpactor project
than on my other projects, although it only has ~<strong>280</strong> stars on Github
(compared to, for example, <a href="https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench">Phpbench</a>'s
~<strong>780</strong>) there are many more people contributing and raising issues and
creating third-party integrations (such as a plugin for
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-php/phpactor.el">emacs</a> and integrations with
completion manages such as <a href="https://github.com/phpactor/ncm2-phpactor">ncm</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kristijanhusak/deoplete-phpactor">deoplete</a>). Having this
feedback is encouraging,</p>

<p>Phpactor is by no means perfect - it will not find <em>all</em> your references, it
will not complete <em>everthing</em> that PHPStorm would, <em>some</em> of the refactorings
will, <em>sometimes</em> leave you with incorrect code. But for the most part it works really well.</p>

<p>It may be that one day Phpactor will be displaced by an even better solution,
which would be fine. But I hope it will continue to grow and that some of the
technical debt can be repaid and that one day some of the libraries will be
stable and even more <a href="https://phpactor.github.io/phpactor/refactorings.html">useful refactorings and
features</a> will be
developed.</p>
