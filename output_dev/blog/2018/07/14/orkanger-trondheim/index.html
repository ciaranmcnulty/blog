<p>When the girl came around to collect the money for camping, it was actually
very cheap, only 60kr (about €6) - cheapest so far, almost by half.</p>

<p>It was quiet enough and I was initially camping on the tent pitch on my own,
but later joined by two other tents, but they were at a good distance from
each-other and not noisy in any case. There was a small party happening in one
of the caravans on the other side of the site making noise until around 12,
inducing me to put my ear-plugs in as I read three chapters of "Memoirs of a
Geisha". Thankfully the noise stopped at around eleven and I slept well until
the morning.</p>

<p>This morning I used the last both of my coffee and my jam. The coffee has
lasted me all this time from Berlin, and I have been drinking a cup a day
(except in the youth hostels where I used their coffee). The Jam also has
lasted since Germany.</p>

<p>I was only at most 70km from Trondheim, so I was in no hurry to leave the
campsite, but ended up leaving at around nine anyway - if there was a chair
and table where I could sit down and work, I might have stayed, but working in
the tent, with my legs folded and the laptop resting on one of my panniers, is
not super-comfortable, and I always experience stretching pains when I stand-up
after sitting cross-legged after a certain duration.</p>

<p>I left the campsite cycling the wrong way but soon realised my error and
turned back. I was listening to the Manic Street Preachers (Gold Against the
Soul), but then changed to another audio-book. Yesterday I did 4 chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655">Howard
Zinn</a>,
today I did three chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens</a>.
Sapiens is also a history, but a pre-history history. So far telling the tale
of the different genus of "homo" of which we, "sapiens" are only one species
of many which used to exist. Lots of profound ideas.</p>

<p>I stopped at a supermarket ("Coop"). As I stopped I didn't really know
<em>why</em> I had stopped, it has just become a routine to stop at a supermarket
once a day. Once inside I just picked up a pastry and two rolls of bread, and
also was able to use the supermarket guest WiFi. I payed in cash, but debated
buying more stuff and paying with card.</p>

<p>I only have 150kr left in cash now, and about 4 days ago I realised that every
time I drew cash from the cash machine, it charged me €6. I had always tried
to take the minimum amount of cash plausible from the machine as I don't want
to leave the country with too much remaining. But if I'm only taking out €40,
then €6 is a very high surcharge (it seems to be a fixed fee). Using the card
"only" costs around 69 cents. But that makes no sense when buying a few bread
rolls and a cake (€3.75).</p>

<p>The cycle route into Trondheim was pretty quiet, and it was cycle paths all
the way to the center. It is the third most populous city in Norway, but has a
low population of 193,000 compared to more populated countries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Statistics!!!</em></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Number of days: 23</li>
  <li>Distance: 2362.3km</li>
  <li>Average per day: 102.69km</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I got to the hostel I parked my bike outside and went in, the reception
was closed but a girl said "hello" and said "check-in is at 15:00" (it was
around 13:00) but she proceeded to open up the reception anyway, and then
found my booking and let me know that the room was already made up and there
was another person in it (otherwise I could put my bike in the room) and that
I could check-in right-away.</p>

<p>Outside I met an old woman who looked my bike up and down "You checking in
<em>here</em> ?" "Yes. I just checked in" "<em>really</em>?" "err, yeah" "ohh, very lucky,
you are very lucky, they don't let people check in until 15:00".</p>

<p>This old lady seems to be a resident, or part of the staff, I'm not sure. But
she stalks around the place checking that everything is in it's right place
and correcting people continuously so that you are likely to make a mess just
out of spite. But I'm sure she means well. But it's a very different
atmosphere from Bergen, but also the facilities are excellent - the bunk beds
are very solid and the facility is modern, and there is a large cupboard of
free food. It cost around €34 for a single bed in a four bed dormitory.</p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>For dinner I have just finished a pizza. It has been 8 days since my last
pizza in Bergen, and it;s nice to have a change from soup.</p>

<p>This evening I need to research my options for getting back to Berlin. This is
potentially, effectively, my last bicycle destination. My first plan is to get
the train to Oslo, and then the train to the south of Sweden in order to get
the ferry to Germany, where I will again get the train. But maybe there are
other options, and maybe I will need to do more cycling before I see Berlin
again.</p>

<p>The plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunday 15th rain to Oslo on Sunday, stay in hostel.</li>
<li>Monday 16-18th: Ride to Gothenburg</li>
<li>19th Train to Malmo (they leave regularly) and cycle to Trelleborg</li>
<li>20th Trelleborg ferry 18:00 arriving in Sassnitz (also leaving at 07:45)</li>
<li>21st Train from Sassnitz to Berlin. 2 regional trains.</li>
</ul>
