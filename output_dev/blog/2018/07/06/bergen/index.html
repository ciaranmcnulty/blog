                 <p>It was waffle night in the hostel. It's a hostel run for 3 summer months by
students from a certain University in Chicago, there are 7 of them here and
they form a "team". During the rest of the year the facility is used for
something else. It's very sociable and friendly.</p>

<p>I have decided to cycle east to Oslo - I am potentially missing some very nice
mountains to the north, but it's half-time and I need to turn back. The
eastern route looks good, and there are 2 cycle paths which I could take, and
one claims to be "downhill all the way to Oslo", there seem to be plenty of
campsites on the road.</p>

<p>I slept badly last night. All of the beds were in a single room, and placed
relatively close together, and the not-so-solid iron beds were stuck against
each other, meaning that my neighbour turning or raising himself up in bed
would cause mine to rock, and same for the person underneath me. This is a
constant irritation with some hostels, and it's always better to have solid
immovable bunks. Then there was the snoring and the small blanket we were
given. I'm normally sleep fine in hostels, but last night not so much.</p>

<p>I woke up at 7am and tried to make coffee, but I couldn't find an Italian
Coffee Maker (mine was locked up with my bike), and I didn't really want to
deplete my coffee in the filter coffee machine. Fortunately I met Colin, who
was starting his second day working at the hostel. He offered to put the
coffee machine on and we had a chat. I mentioned that I would run up one of
the mountains today, and he said that he'd like to come along, so we would run
up the biggest of the seven mountains the city is famed for: Ulriken.</p>

<p>I had breakfast: Boiled eggs, jam sandwich, cheese and a yoghurt. All costing
only â‚¬3, exceptionally cheap for Norway. I had to Google "How to boil an egg".
I then worked on my open-source programming project for an hour before we left
to run the mountain.</p>

<p>We ran in the direction of the ski lift and found the trail around 20 minutes
from the hostel. We started to run up, Colin taking the lead and he was faster
than me and would often pause and wait for me to catch up. I started well, but
after 25 minutes started to slow down. The trail was very rocky and technical,
at the bottom we ran over loose rocks and tree roots, and these gave way more
to larger rocks until the trees disappeared and we made the final ascent. I
scrambled on all fours up the rock faces and we made it to the top.</p>

<p><em>Colin and I at the TV Tower</em></p>

<p>There was a TV tower and lots of hikers and the view was good. Colin said
"Shall we run to that one, it's not very far" he pointed. I said "err, why
not?". We ran down and then started up again, the peak was Ulriken and was
680m - not that high, but we started from sea-level.</p>

<p><em>Colin by the Cairn at the top of Ulriken</em></p>

<p>The way down was fun, if not very fast, as care was required not to slip and
fall over. In total I think we ran for about an hour and forty-five minutes.</p>
