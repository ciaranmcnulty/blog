                 <p>This morning I woke with a stomach ache and there was lots of groaning as I
packed up my damp tent and filled my water bottles and tenderly made my way
back to the road.</p>

<p>The sky was and is overcast and has been so all day, but it hasn't been
raining.</p>

<p>The cycle route went indirectly around the coast, but there was another road
cutting straight across the land which saved around 15k. I wanted to make it
as far as possible today. There is a stretch to Trondheim of around 70k
without any campsites, so I wanted to get to the last one before that.</p>

<p>The road took me on to Norway's <a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/northwest/listings-northwest/national-tourist-route-atlanterhavsvegen/11862/">Engineering feat of the
century</a> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean_Road">Atlantic Ocean Road</a>. It took 6 years to build and was partially financed by tolls until 1999 when
the tolls were removed.</p>

<p><em>View from the Atlantic Road</em></p>

<p>This was the first time I really smelt the salty sea air as I rode over the
scattered mini-islands and bridges. There was lots of tourist traffic, and
camper vans, and people walking about on purpose-made bridges, clambering on
the rocks and looking at the sea.</p>

<p>I stopped for a coffee, my first coffee in Norway, it cost only 20kr (~€2) and
was filter coffee served in a paper cup. It tasted good though and made me
feel better.</p>

<p>After this I was riding to the end of the cycle path - or rather to the
Kristiansund tunnel through which I was required either to take a taxi or get
the bus.</p>

<p>As I rode up there was a cycle-route sign which provided me with this
information, it didn't say how often the buses ran though, it only gave me a
website, which I couldn't check, because <em>I have no mobile data</em>. Fortunately
there was a timetable across the way, unfortunately it had been battered by
the elements and was mostly illegible, but I could make out the possibility
that the bus ran maybe every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I waited, and very soon a bus appeared and pulled in. The driver got out and
put my baggage in the hold and I put my bike on the bus (there was a
wheelchair space). The bus could have carried 60 people, but there was only
one other passenger on this ride. It cost around €7. The tunnel went
underground and covered around 8km, when we exited the tunnel the driver
continued to the bus station in Kristiansund where I got out.</p>

<p>I had previously this day gone into an Intersport shop to try and find some
Camping Gaz, they didn't have any, but they suggested I try in Kristiansund,
so this was my first priority.</p>

<p>I first tried a hardware store, and they referred me to a maritime store. I
asked in English if they had any Camping Gaz, and they did. I paid (€14) and
said "Mange tak" (many thanks), and in return I got a "Har det bra" (goodbye):
my first successful Norwegian language transaction! Later in the day I also
managed to understand the amount I had to pay at a supermarket without
reverting to English.</p>

<p>I didn't stay long in Kirstiansund, I made my exit, riding through a section
of the harbour which seemed like a working ship-building museum.</p>

<p><em>View of Kristiansund from a bridge</em></p>

<p>I had now done about 75k, it was 15:00 and I hadn't eaten anything, and didn't
feel particularly tired or hungry and I was soon on the Tømmervåg ferry (cost
€4). On the ferry I made myself a sandwich while the other passengers helped
them selves expensive self-service food. 25 minutes later I rolled off the
ferry.</p>

<p><em>View from a bridge, not on Kristiansund</em></p>

<p>This was the last ferry before Trondheim, and very probably the last ferry in
Norway on this trip. I'm not very sad - the ferries are a pain, and while most
of them have been running regularly, I have had issues with some that required
me to wait for so many hours, and of course they cost money.</p>

<p>On the final stretch it was very quiet - other than the periodic batch of
traffic from the ferry. A racing cyclist pulled up next to me, he was an older
man (probably retired) and we had a chat for around 10 to 15 minutes, the
normal stuff, where I'm from, where I'm going, where I'm <em>eventually</em> going,
etc. He recommended the campsite that I'm staying at now.</p>

<p><em>Clouds</em></p>

<p>This campsite showed up on my map as "INTERNET-ACCESS: FEE CHARGED". Which
doesn't make it sound overalls appealing, but there was no other option (there
was another campsite, but it was on an island which required another ferry
trip).</p>

<p>The Wifi is however, is very free indeed (no password required). They also
have a kitchen (and the cooker doesn't cost anything). Today I bought some
dried peas, and I'm trying to cook a mainly pea soup, the peas have been
cooking for an hour now, and still not mushy, don't think they are the right
kind (think I should have gotten split-peas), but hopefully they will be soft
enough to be edible.</p>

<p>My final destination, Trondheim, is still around 170km away, which is
certainly doable in a day, but it wouldn't be a pleasant day at all. So I will
stay at another campsite tomorrow, and hopefully book a hostel in Trondheim,
or buy a train ticket and get the night train directly.</p>
