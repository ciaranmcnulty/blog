<p>I woke up this morning at 7am to the sound of pouring rain. The bed was
comfortable but I felt exhausted and my head hurt. I got up and looked in the
mirror, I had bags under my eyes. Yesterday was a hard day. Today would be
much better, but I didn't know it yet.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served from 7 and I went down at half past, the lady was already
there and had prepared my place. I had asked her the night before if she could
prepare a vegetarian breakfast, and I got the standard breakfast without meat:
an egg, cheese, jam, two bread rolls and a big jug of coffee. It was a good
breakfast and cost comparatively little, just €5.</p>

<p>I went upstairs and packed my stuff away, left the key in the door and went
down to bike, it was raining mildly and I dug out the cycle computer which I
had canibalised from my racer in Berlin. I wripped the old one off (I didn't
have the computer unit for it) and put the new one on, then I realised I
didn't steal the accompanying wheel-magnet from the Racer, but luckily the
existing one worked (as you would expect, with it just being a magnet, but I'm
sure I have had problems before, maybe to do with strength and sensor
sensitivity). I calibrated it to my 26" wheel, I hope. Otherwise my distances
will be wrong.</p>

<p>I set off. As already mentioned I didn't feel great, but was better for the
breakfast. Pretty soon my legs and hips started aching, and it got gradually
worse for about an hour and I wondered if I would even make it to Bremen. If I
stopped the bike and put weight on my right leg it would seize up painfully.</p>

<p>I noticed that the pain happened most significantly when my leg extended, and
the seat was quite high, I lowered it and it was immediately better. Over the
subsequent hour it got gradually worse but then it just got better again.</p>

<p>As with yesterday, it alternated between rain and wind and sun. Occasionally I
would feel a warmth run though my body and I thought that this was my immune
system (or something) kicking in - maybe it decided that this level of exertion
wasn't going to stop, so it did something about it. Whatever happened I was
soon at a self-sustaining level and 3 hours after I started I knew I would
have any more problems. I am now sitting in the campsite and my legs feel
fine.</p>

<p>The route was mostly flat today, which accounted for my good time, I managed
to keep an average speed of around 20kmph, my overall average is lower because
I cycled through Bremen.</p>

<p>It was about 65km to Bremen from Diepholz and I was there at around 12:30 in
time for lunch. I was looking for places to sit down, got to the toilet and
buy a drink. Its usually quite to rare to find all three of these things
together (and I have often postponed my lunch by hours just looking for two of
them) so I was happy when I encountered the banks of the Weser. There were
many benches (with back rests) all the green, grassy, banks. There was a
mobile toilet (good because I could keep my bike close), and a kiosk.</p>

<p><em>River Weser, Bremen</em></p>

<p>I went to the loo, got a Club-Maté drink (€1.80 - pretty expensive) and sat
down and cracked open a can of baked beans and the stale bread buns I had
bought the day before.</p>

<p>I cycled through the center of Bremen, and saw the Bremer Dom (Bremen
Cathedral) and the Alte Rathaus (old town hall). Very gothic looking
structures. I also saw a strange large tower, and I wondered if it was
Europes tallest Minaret - but it was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallturm_Bremen">Fallturm</a> (literally fall
tower) in which 9 seconds of weightlessness can be produced apparently).</p>

<p>I would have liked to have stayed longer in Bremen, but this trip is all about
getting as far up the west coast as Norway as possible in a month.</p>

<p>Not wanting to be stuck for accommodation again I had downloaded the offline
map Lower Saxony which includes POIs (Points Of Interest), among which are
campsites. There was a campsite in the town of Zeven which I guessed would be
around the 100km mark, so that was my destination.</p>

<p>I rolled past the 100km barrier and felt good. Probably could have kept going
all the way to Hamburg, but again maybe a bit too early in the tour for really
long distances.</p>

<p>The cycle network in Germany has been really good, I haven't cycled on a
single busy road, there are always cycle paths, and most of them are pretty
good.</p>

<p>In Zeven I have found a great campsite (Camping Sonnencamp). It cost €10
(showers included) and I have pitched my tent next to a shelter with a picnic
table inside, and there is a power outlet. It is peaceful and the sun is out.</p>
