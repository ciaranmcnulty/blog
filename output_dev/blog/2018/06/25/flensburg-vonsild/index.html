<p>I am now sitting under the eaves of a chalet in a Danish campsite, my tent is pitched
in front of me and I'm overlooking a pond with ducks swimming in it, the sun
has shining. I was sceptical about this campsite to start with, it was just
off the main road and there were plenty of other options further off the track
in more desirable locations, but I had done my time for the day so I risked
it.</p>

<p>There was a man standing by the gate who welcomed me and said that it cost €10
and gave me directions as to where I could pitch my tent and informed me that
the showers and other facilities were all free. I said that I had Kroner or,
€10. I flashed the note out of my walet and he said in a Danish matter-of-fact
way "That is ten euros".</p>

<p>I was glad to stop because the sun came out today which was welcome at first,
but after 3 hours I could feel myself starting to burn. I had a cap to
protect my head, but my hands were visibly going red.</p>

<p><em>Things I need to buy</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summer cycling gloves</li>
<li>Chain lubricant</li>
<li>Another tyre lever</li>
<li>More underpants</li>
</ul>

<p>The day started in the hostel, I woke up as normal at around 7am, my head
hurting somewhat. Looking in the mirror I still had large bags under my eyes.
Strange that I seem to be tired, but seemingly unable to get anymore rest than
usual. Breakfast was a buffet.</p>

<p>A man greeted me and then asked if I had my breakfast token, I searched myself
and I did not. I went back to the room and turned it over, it wasn't there. I
went back and he said not to worry about it and some other stuff that I didn't
understand. I ate a bowl of muesli, two bread rolls, two slices of cheese, I
drank a glass of orange juice and two coffees. Then I left.</p>

<p>It was a short ride to the Danish border, which I passed straight through (as
Denmark is in Schengen area). I then found myself in the town of Padborg. I
got some money (500KN, or about €67) and searched around for a supermarket (I
had very few supplies left).</p>

<p>There was the Netto discount supermarket familiar from Germany, and a new one
(sounded like "Burger") and so far these are the only two supermarkets I have
seen. I studied the exterior of the Burger market - I always prefer a
supermarket with a glass front through I which I can keep an eye on my bike
while shopping. This one reall didn't have one, but I could put in front of
the door.</p>

<p>I removed my laptop bag, detached my mobile phone, put the lock around the
wheel and went inside.</p>

<p><em>East sea</em></p>

<p>First stop, muesli - I need something for breakfast on the campsite. Then
assorted nuts for munching on the road. The nuts I found were ridiculously
expensive (40KN, about €4.50) and they were only 150g bags. There was a
cheaper packet of discount salted peanuts below them for 10KN (€1.40) which I
got. Then I got some vegetable broth (almost €4) and some dried banana flakes.
I was tempted later in the day to buy a beer, but a single can cost around
€2.50!</p>

<p>Denmark is expensive I think I've spent at least €25 on shopping today, twice
as much as in Germany.</p>

<p>I lost my way several times today so my route was not the one I expected
(following the EuroVelo 3). I took a wrong turn and was on a different cycle
route which (Ostsee weg) which ran closer to the sea (the EV3 runs more in the
middle). By the time I realised I was too far gone to turn back, so I adjusted
my plans and carried on. I can probably join back up with the EV3 tomorrow.</p>

<p>Again, the cycle path certainly added more kilometers and if I had taken the
road I would have been further north than I am now. But the path was
interesting, often going onto rough country lanes and dirt paths, running
through forests and up short, steep ascents. These sections put more content
into the day.</p>

<p><em>Pretty Forest Paths</em></p>

<p>The Danish language is only familiar to me through TV, but much of the signage
is vaguely similar to German (Bageri (DN) is Bäckerei (DE) is Bakery (EN)).
But when cashiers have told me the amount I need to pay it didn't sound
remotely like German. I will try and learn some basics while I am here if I am
able (like, for example, "thankyou").</p>

<p>The campsite is one of the cleanest campsites I have been in (especially
regarding the facilities) where the others have been in Switzerland.</p>
