<p>Another good nights sleep and I augmented my breakfast once again, this time
with chocolate milk - Muesli, jam, chocolate milk and coffee. I set out to
follow what officially seems to be the
<a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-12">EV12</a> but is marked on
signs and on my phone as
<a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-1">EV1</a>.</p>

<p>I was soon confused having arrived at a closed pedestrian/cycle bridge and
yet all the while seeing people cycling accross it - where were the going? I
wondered. Following them I found the ingress and the cycle path followed the
highway out of the city.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_120037.jpg"/></p>

<p>The sun was shining again, but not as fiercely as the previous days, and the
cycle path diverged from the highway and followed an incredibly peaceful road
and I cycled for about 3 hours letting my mind wonder and observing the
Norwegian landscape.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was the houses - they are majority of them seem to
be made of wood, with either long vertical or horizontal planks, and often
painted white or red.</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_121619.jpg"/></p>

<p>Then of course there is the rugged landscape, riding along the coast there are
huge slabs of rock and ample forest. With the wooden houses dotted around,
sometimes 4 clustered in a small valley.</p>

<p>The time is really flying by now. I've done 2 hours before I'm aware of it.
Today I did almost 8.</p>

<p>I stopped at a supermarket, the first I had seen in hours, and was at first
deterred by the business of the place, hundreds of parked cars and people
everywhere (it was a group of supermarket-type shops). But outside my market
was a group of salespeople trying (as I found out) to sell cheaper electricity
to people leaving the shop, so I figured they would notice if anybody tried to
ransack my bike.</p>

<p>Inside I got more muesli, a couple of bananas, a loaf of bread and a can of
beer. I got one of the "cheaper" <em>cans</em> of beer, and it cost around €2.15, and
this was a discount market. I think the cheapest one (I found) in Denmark was
about €1.80. In total my shopping cost around €8.</p>

<p>Realising I had forgotten to buy Pasta, I stopped again a few kilometers
further on at a shop next to a lake and got the pasta and a cheap sugary
vanilla pastry. Paying with cash was confusing as I now have a mixture of
Danish and Norwegian kroner, and I had to ask the cashier to sort them for me.
I then sat on a picnic table outside in the sun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_155427.jpg" alt="Is this a Fjord" /></p>

<p><em>A Fjord, I think</em></p>

<p>A couple of sections were very tough. At one point the cycle path continued
from a perfectly good road up a very steep gravel incline and I wondered if
somebody was joking. I checked my map, and that was indeed the path, so I
clicked down (up?) to my highest gear and started grinding away. This was
around 3 of rough and steep up and down.</p>

<p>Near the end of this section I spied another cyclist heading my way, I could
see a small flag flying behind him. He approached with a friendly smile and we
both stopped and he talked to me in Norwegian and then in English, he asked
where I was going, where I'm from and so on, then told me about his journey.</p>

<p>He has been travelling the coast for 4 months. Starting on the border of Russia above
Finland (he was Finish). First of all he skied, then he used a kayak and now
he is cycling, I looked confused and looked at his bicycle - "Oh, I have a
car" he said. So I guessed he was travelling sections then taking the train
back to his car. He was now on his last leg to Kristiansand where he would get
the train back home.</p>

<p>The last challenge of the day was the first "mountain" of the journey.
Although it was only 260m of altitude (less depending on how high I started)
it was a very steep and long climb. I was ascending at the speed of about
4kmph for stretches of it and rarely rose above 7 with sweat pouring from my
body.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-06-29/IMG_20180629_170213.jpg" alt="The summit" /></p>

<p><em>The top</em></p>

<p>After this I decided to stop a bit earlier than anticipated as I had already
done 110km. It was a choice between two campsites, one called "Bibelcamp"
located on the coast, and the other somewhat inland. I choose "Biblecamp"
which I thought might be a christian indoctrination center, but I can't see
any religious symbols anywhere.</p>

<p>It cost only €10 and I have now eaten (lentils and pasta again) and am sitting
under the eaves of the main building with my plugged in to an out-of-door
socket. My powerpack is running a bit low, might see if I can leave it
charging in reception overnight.</p>
