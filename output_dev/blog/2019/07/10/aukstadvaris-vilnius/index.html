             <div>
                 <p>This was the third time camping on this trip, and the third time I had a bad
night, and the third time I had blamed my sleeping mattress. On the previous
tour I had a "full length" air mattress - a self inflating air mattress that
stretched from my head to my feat. This was a perfect mattress, except that it
had developed a micro-puncture, which seems to be undetectable (have held it
underwater for 10s of minutes and no sign of air release), and after 4 hours
of sleep it would deflate and I would wake and not sleep so well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/1.JPG" alt="Stefan" /></p>

<p><em>Stefan</em></p>

<p>Six years ago I had gotten a "half air mattress" which covered the upper body
but left the lower body on the ground -- at the time I remembered it as an
improvement on my situation - it used 1/4 of the space required by a full size
mattress, and, to my memory, was just as comfortable. But now my feet were
cold, and I woke after 3 hours of sleep and was not comfortable at all, and a
mosquito was circling around the interior of my tent periodically buzzing in
my eat until I eventually had the initiative to exterminate it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/0.JPG" alt="Campsite lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake by the campsite</em></p>

<p>In the morning (when was the morning? I woke at 3am 4:30am, 5:30am, 6am. ..)
at 7am I thought it would be a good time to wake, but instead I went back to
sleep which was surprisingly easy, waking again at 8am and peeped out of my
tent into the campsite and saw Stefan sitting on the bench, and offered a cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>I made two coffees and some porridge and read the news on my phone and packed
my tent and we left the campsite and rode down the main rode to Trakai. Trakai
was around 25km from the campsite, and from Trakai it was aroudn 25hm to
Vilnius, and from Trokai we could leave the main road onto a minor road, and
in Torkai we could see the most photographed castle in all of Lithuania -
the Trokai Castle. We saw the castle and took a photo of it without crossing
it's moat and went back for coffee.</p>

<p>At the coffee place there were a group of motorcyclists and Stefan asked if I
understood the language they were speaking, when I paid attention it was a
"strange" dialect of German. The south-germans were talkative.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/2.JPG" alt="Castle and tourists" /></p>

<p><em>Castle and tourists</em></p>

<p>We ordered coffee and pasties (the same as in England, crispy hot pastry with
various fillings) and it started raining and I started looking at the internet
for good options for a hostel for the night, Stefan had originally planed to
stay at the campsite, but decided to give the hostel a chance.</p>

<p>There was no cycling infrastructure entering the city, we had to ride on the
bust dual-carriage way, or ride on the pavement, but were able to find a road
leading directly to the hostel.</p>

<p>On the way the sky started spitting rain drops, and from the previous days we
both knew that this predicted a heavy down pour in around 5 miunutes, I was
happy to get wet, wearing only quick-drying clothes and sandals, but Stefan
was wearing his only shoes, trainers, which would not dry quickly. We made our
way back to the shelter of a door in front of a business enterance in a
parking lot, after standing there for 10 minutes a lady came out and asked
simply "Coffee?". I turned around and said "No, it's stopped raining and I
think we can be going now". In retrospect it would have been better to have
accepted, but on leaving we said thankyou for the offer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/5.JPG" alt="Vilnius and rain" /></p>

<p><em>Vilnius and rain</em></p>

<p>We were looking for the hostel "Hostelgate", and I the hostel was clearly
marked on my map, and we cycled towards it, and then past it, and the got
confused and then went back. Stefan noticed that there was a door with
"hostel" on the doorbell, but it wasn't Hostelgate, he buzzed and a man
answered and said he would come down and meet us.</p>

<p>The guy was friendly and offered to show us the hostel, we bought the bikes
inside the premises and the hostel was clean and good, it small. I had
originally checked "Hotelgate" hostel, but it turns out my map was
out-of-date, and that the hostel had moved two years ago, and this hostel was
subsequently a guest-house, and recently converted back to a hostel, in
anycase it's a good hostel.</p>

<p>After taking as shower and dozing on the bed for an hour we went for a walk in
the town, and I went to the museum while Stefan went to the castle and we
would meet back at the hostel later.</p>

<p>The museum was huge - there are four "tours", each which can be purchased
separately for â¬3, I got the whole set for â¬7 and started the first tour at
4pm. The first tour was the history of Lithuania from the perspective of the
ruling classes from pre-historic times to modern.  The tour lead onto an
air-conditioned interior exhibition of an actual archaeological excavation,
with glass paned, raised, walkways leading through the ruins of the destroyed
castle. I spent 2 hours walking around tour 1 before closing at 6pm, and I can
still use the ticket to visit the other 3 tours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-10/4.JPG" alt="Bell tower" /></p>

<p><em>Bell tower</em></p>

<p>As I was leaving the museum I got a text message from Stefan, from an hour
back, saying that for some reason we had each-others keys for the padlocks to
our lockers. When I got back to the hostel we went out to get something to
eat, eventually ending up in the place the hostel guy had recommend, they
didn't have much in the way of vegetarian food, and I had a "traditional cold
beetroot soup" followed by "4 potato pancakes with mayonnaise", then we had
several more beers.</p>

<p>On returning to the hostel, we met the other two inhabitants of our 4 bed room
who were from Brazil, one of which was a geologist and presented his theory on
why there was so much bloody sand in northern Poland and Lithuania.</p>

<p>And now it is 2:45am and I still need to upload the photos and publish this
blog post.</p>
