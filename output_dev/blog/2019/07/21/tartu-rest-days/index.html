                 <p>I intended to stay two nights in Tartu, but have ended up staying three. There
seem to be no logical resting places for tomorrows journey within a 120km
distance (other than hotels which I would consider to be beyond what I'd be
happy to pay), and the next campsite is on the coast, which would be 155km - a
long day. The following day I could do an even longer day and make it all the
way to Talinn, which is either 100km direct, or, if following the coast (and I
really should follow the coast) it's almost 163km, 100 miles and this last
act of masochism seems fitting for the last journey on this trip, although
there is also an outdoor "hostel" or "retreat" in the forest outside of
Tallinn which has been recommended to me twice, so that may break my journey.</p>

<p>In Tartu I got drunk the first night with a guy who was here for Metallica
concert (to be fair it was mainly me doing the drinking, he was waiting to get
the bus back at 2am), the next day I went for a run.</p>

<p>Tartu is situated on a river and has a few parks on it's south bank, and I was
able to run through these parks and then back along the river bank, over the
bridge in the center of town and then along the other side to another bridge.
The weather has been very fine, and there were very few people to be found
outside of the town (just a couple of people fishing, and the occasional
jogger).</p>

<p>Inside the town on my first day it was uncomfortably packed, as there was some
kind of "Medieval" festival happening, but when I found myself in the throng
of the crowd, my instinct was to remove myself as quickly as possibly, the
only medieval thing I saw was a single lost-looking woman in a medieval
(or Tudor) costume. But I'm told by some of the hostel guests that it really
was a lot of fun.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<p>Other than this I have been making solid efforts on my programming project,
which is rather starting to annoy me now, and I'm wonder at the amount of time
I have spent on this thing (it has been in the works since March). I hope it's
finished to a useful state soon and provides some redeeming value.</p>

<p>Last night I researched books to read, I'm currently reading "The Castle", an
unfinished novel by Franz Kafka, but after 150 pages, not really enjoying it.
I found a list of 100 books to read before you die, the top one was "To kill a
mockingbird", which I already read, the second was "Pride and Prejudice",
which I hadn't (and somehow it doesn't appeal to me), and somewhere on the
list I found "Jane Eyre", which I happened to have on my ebook device, so I'm
starting with that now.</p>

<p>I am now sitting in the hostel after having eaten my breakfast and am about to
leave, the weather has been excellent for the past two days, but today it
looks to rain and I can fill the cool air blowing through the open window to
my back.</p>
