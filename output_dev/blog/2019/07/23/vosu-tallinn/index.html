             <div>
                 <p>I'm sitting in the Eurphoria hostel in Tallinn, I got in around an hour and a
half ago, and have briefly explored the tourist saturated center, then came
back here and played guitar and piano for about an hour and a guy just came in
and sat at the drums. There is all the tools required for a band in this room,
which is one of the reasons I was attracted to this hostel, and I may be
staying here for a week.</p>

<p>I slept well last night and before sleeping watched the final two episodes of
Game of Thrones, and the <em>ending</em> wasn't as bad as I feared. This morning I
woke up hungry, which accorded with the number of kilometers I made yesterday,
I went out to the shop, but it was 8:30 and not open until 10, so I used the
hostel kitchen to make a breakfast with what I had: porridge, jam, partially
melted cheese slices and coffee.</p>

<p>It was now only 70k to Tallinn on the main road, and I guessed 100k by taking
some of the diversions through the Lahemaa National Park. I would now
certainly be staying in Tallinn this night, and so I researched hostels on
<code>hostelworld.com</code> and chose the Euphoria hostel (there were a number of nice
looking hostels, but the fact that Euphoria had a piano and a guitar swung it
for me), I phoned ahead and made sure they could store my bike, and booked
(online, as they weren't keen on booking me over the phone).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/1.JPG" alt="Recommended" /></p>

<p><em>The much recommended Project Kodu, which I passed, but I could have cycled
an extra 21k yesterday and stayed here if I had known</em></p>

<p>I left the hostel, dropping the keys at the post office next door - as
instructed - and when I handed the keys to the man behind the counter he
looked very confused, and pointed to the hostel next door, I insisted that I
had been asked to leave the keys here, and he went inside and fetched a lady -
possibly the very same who I met the previous evening - who understood and
took the keys - I honestly can't remember if it was the same lady or not.</p>

<p>I then rode out of Vosu and continued my journey through the national park.
Despite the road looking like it was following the coast, there were very few
occasions where I could actually see the sea, and the majority of the route
was the same -- trees lining each side of the road. But it was very quiet,
especially after I had a mantrum at my phone's audio player and decided it
wasn't worth the effort and unplugged it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/2.JPG" alt="Smoke on the water" /></p>

<p><em>Smoke on the water</em></p>

<p>I had given up on my MP3 player, and thought I'd try playing music from my
phone, but the phone's audio player was incredibly, to my eyes, badly
designed. All it has to do, according to me, is play files, organised by
folders, sorted by filenames - but no. It does no such thing, it probably does
just about everything else, but not that. So I lost my temper and was cursing
my phone for being so shitting stupid, and when I finally listened to music I
was in no mood, so I unplugged it and the rest of my day was silent.</p>

<p>When I did finally pass some coast I looked out across the Baltic sea to
Finland (I was mistaken) , and could see a column of cloud rising on the
horizon, it first occurred to me that it was smoke and something was on fire,
but then it was the wrong colour for smoke, so I guessed it was steam, and my
guess was confirmed later - I was looking at some kind of power plant outside
of Tallinn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/3.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Road</em></p>

<p>It was hot today, and as I started to feel thirsty, and then hungry (more so
for the longer day yesterday), I wanted an energy drink, in previous tours it
was beer, this time it's energy drinks, I need something at least slightly
malevolent for lunch, and I couldn't find a shop, eventually I realised that I
had a can of baked beans at least, and that would be more than enough for
lunch - all I needed now was a bench.</p>

<p>As it happened the next bench was 15km away - which is always the case - and
there was also a shop, so I got both an energy drink, some bread and 4
individually wrapped chocolates. I sat down on a bench outside of the close-by
post office and ate the beans, the bread, the chocolates and a pint of energy
drink, and then read a chapter of the book, and I was quite full.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/4.JPG" alt="Source of the smoke" /></p>

<p><em>Source of the smoke</em></p>

<p>Coming into Tallinn, there was the EuroVelo route, but it seemed unnecessarily
complex, and I tried to follow the main road, which was at this point dual
carriageway, but there were smaller roads either side with cycle paths, but
these were awful to cycle on, continuing only for half a kilometer before
turning one way or another and no clear indication of where they were going,
making me frustrated - I just wanted to follow a road for 4km - so in the end
I joined the now 3-lane dual carriage way, there were no signs prohibiting
cyclists, so I guess this was fine, if not comfortable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/5.JPG" alt="TV tower" /></p>

<p><em>TV tower, similar to the one in Berlin</em></p>

<p>The hostel I arrived at easily enough and checked in, there were already
people playing music.</p>

<p>I have just played for about another hour, and now when writing this blog some
guy has pulled out his saxophone accompanied by picked chords on an electric
guitar, it's jazz and it sounds as amazing as a saxophone does cutting into
the empty air.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/6.JPG" alt="View on Tallinn" /></p>

<p><em>View on the old town close to the hostel</em></p>

<p>This is potentially my last post, this was my original destination. I just
found out that the ferry to Helsinki is not as expensive as I thought (maybe
only €20) but the ferry to Trevemunde will be much more expensive, so I will
likely get the bus, but will see what happens in the next week - which is a
long time.</p>
