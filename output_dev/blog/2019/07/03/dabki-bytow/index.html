             <div>
                 <p>I'm glad that I turned inland. I decided to head to the town of Bytów which
was only 100km from the town, and would be a stepping stone to Gdansk. The
people I dealt with have all been unquestionably friendly and the roads have
been quiet.</p>

<p>I left the hotel without fanfare at around 08:00. I felt pretty horrible -
when I got into the hotel last night I looked in the mirror and I had heavy
bags under my eyes, and I felt like I had heavy bags under my eyes. It's the
100 mile look, more over 100 miles of which a good deal of those miles were
not easy. I managed to eat a large pizza and a whole bar of chocolate the
night before. In the morning the bags were gone, but I felt hungry and still
tired.</p>

<p>First priority was breakfast then. I rode east to the next town at which point
I would be able to take a secondary road south-east towards Bytów. The town,
unlike the others, was quite nice and had some history, there were normal
people here. I found an open cafe and ordered a cappuccino and a bakery snack
and sat outside the cafe in view of my bike, and the coffee helped to wake me
up. I then had a slow ride around the town, ostensibly looking for either a
bicycle or headphone shop, but really just exploring.</p>

<p>The wind has been behind me the whole time and today was no exception as I
cycled effortlessly down the quiet country road. I felt good and sang along to
the music which was playing in my head. I still didn't have any headphones,
but my brain seems to play it's own music anyway -- today it was Venus in
Furs (Velvet Underground), yesterday it was a Chopin Nocturne and I think
Pulp's "Common People" made it in somewhere.</p>

<p>I stopped at the next town and resolved to find some headphones, after cycling
around the small number of shops I settled on the only one which claimed to
sell computer accessories. I demobilised the bike outside the shop window and
went inside, on the left was a counter behind which were stacks of computer
accessories, on the other-side they were selling stationary. I found a display
with in-ear headphones, and after waiting for the guy to serve another
customer he greeted me and I asked if he spoke English: "Of course!" he
replied. He seemed so happy, and was obviously glad to be able to use his
English skills, after we had agreed on the pair of headphones I would buy, he
asked "How is my English?" I replied with "Dobre!" (good). It was just a
simple transaction, but it left a good impression on me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/1.JPG" alt="Headphone town" /></p>

<p><em>The town where I got my headphones</em></p>

<p>I was skeptical about the headphones -- I had never heard of the brand, and
they were the most expensive headphones of that type in the shop (€12) - twice
as much as the pair the guy had recommend to me in fact. So I was happy with
the quality, there was good low and high frequencies. The only problem was
that they were the weird, now standard, plug-into-your-ear-completely type -
ironically "for sport", but the effect is that you can hear all the low
frequency rumblings from anything that's connect to your body -- on a bike
this is the rolling sound and bumps on the road, when running the constant
thump-thump of your feet on the pavement. So actually, useless for sport. Best
suited to lying on your bed and not moving. Given a choice I always prefer the
type that just rest in your ears (peak circa 1999).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/2.JPG" alt="Improving cycle network" /></p>

<p><em>The cycle network has been quite good so far, and still under construction</em></p>

<p>I now had music available to play, this is a nice facility sometimes, as you
can get transported away, but equally you can rely too much on it. The most
practical benefit will be that I will be able to start doing some Polish
lessons (and maybe a language or two from the other countries I will visit, if
I can find any).</p>

<p>For lunch I had acquired an energy drink and a bread roll - so I stopped on a
bench and had a peanut-butter and nut sandwich, that is, peanut butter, and
mixed with some mixed nuts. My reasoning is that there is protein in there
somewhere.</p>

<p>I rolled into Bytów after a reasonable short amount of time relative to the
previous two days. It wasn't as easy as I thought to find a hotel, and I had
to google, and then it was much more expensive than I had thought (€35
compared to the €16 yesterday), but breakfast is included, and I'm not on a
strict budget.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/3.JPG" alt="Church in Bytow" /></p>

<p><em>Religion is still here</em></p>

<p>The bike was still missing the rear breaks due to the screw falling out on the
cobbles on day one, I asked at reception about a bike shop (via. google
translate) and she made two hand gestures indicating "turn right" then "left".
I left and surely found a bicycle shop, the young man who served me spoke
great English (most if not all young people speak good English). He provided
me with a new screw, for free, and I should now be one again at 100% breaking
capacity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/4.JPG" alt="Courtyard" /></p>

<p><em>Inside the Teutonic courtyard</em></p>

<p>The main attraction in Bytów is it's Teutonic Castle, built originally by the
Knight of the Tutonic order before changing hands several times and being
extended and rebuilt over the centuries. I had a look, and visited the large
and (at the time) rather empty museum for 10 Zsloty (around €2.30 or so). As
with all museums I felt chronically tired after visiting 30%, but I persisted
and found it interesting. At one point the only other visitor approached me
and started speaking in Polish, then in English asked me to "take photo".
"Follow!" he said. I followed him to the top room of the tower, where there
was a miniature of the castle as it would have looked in Medieval times, and a
knights helmet and sword for photographic purposes. He asked me to take a
picture of him with the helmet and sword for his son, who "really likes this
sort of thing". After doing this, he asked if I'd like him to take a photo of
me, and I agreed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-03/5.JPG" alt="Dangerous person" /></p>

<p><em>Stay away from this guy</em></p>

<p>After the museum I found a cafe, and worked for an hour on some open-source
project, then went to a Pizzeria opposite the hotel (what else can I eat in
Poland?). The woman there was also very happy to speak English with me, and
was very welcoming, I've now finished the Pizza and am still sitting here
drinking sparkling water (they had no beer).</p>
