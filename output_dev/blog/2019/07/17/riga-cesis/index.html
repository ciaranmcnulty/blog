                 <p>Typing this in a Pizzeria as usual, but unfortunately my laptop's power was
drained s I'm typing this awkwardly on my phone. I am in Cēsis, an historical
town 100km north-east of Riga.</p>

<p>At the hostel I woke relatively late, 9:00, and was able to take advantage of
the free waffles for breakfast, washing them down with a good deal of free
coffee.</p>

<p>After two days rest my arse was road worthy again. I was glad to leave the
hostel, having not really been succeeded in being effectively social and felt
detatched (for no good reason), but I was also reluctant hit the road again,
lacking mental energy.</p>

<p>I did however openly discuss my trajectory during my stay and heading
northeast towards Tartu in Estonia looks like a good target, it has about 4
hostels and apparently is a student town - and would take me through this
town, Cēsis which is famous for it's castle (again related to the once
omni-present Tutonic knights).</p>

<p>There was a cycle path accompanying the main road out of Riga which alternated
sides of the 4 labe,busy, road. This ended after a period however and I
switched to forest and country roads, before the main road split a.d the
traffic was much reduced. I flowed this until the town of Sigulda.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/1.JPG" alt="Road out of Riga" /></p>

<p><em>Road out of Riga</em></p>

<p>Here it started spitting raina and the sky had the now familiar even leaden
pregnant look which gave this spitting rain the significance of predicting a
heavy downpour. Cēais was off the main route and I headed north east out of
the town and the asphalt gave way to the beloved gravel, soon after tgethunder
started rolling and it rained hard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/2.JPG" alt="Back to sand" /></p>

<p><em>More sand</em></p>

<p>I also discovered that I was riding on the "tour de LatEst" cycle route, which
is marked on my map and which goes at least to this town, and probably all the
way to Tartu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/5.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>LatEst</em></p>

<p>The gravel-sand is more problematic in the rain, and the sand grains are
attracted to my gears causing them to crunch, grind and vacillate (??).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/4.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>These caves entrances were scattered everywhere at Līgatne</em></p>

<p>I avoided energy drinks today and managed thus to avoid road directed
tantrums, instead again listening to the Howard Zinn book and largely ignoring
the road, rain and thunder. I seem to be missing around 10 chapters and was
fast forwarded to the Clinton administration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/6.JPG" alt="Bridge of Doom" /></p>

<p><em>There was a diversion which I missed, and this bridge was the cause of it -
luckily I could cross (even if I risked being impaled by the exposed iron
works)</em></p>

<p>I had stopped for a coffee in Sigulda outside the train station, I sat down and
they had free wifi. (no password - which seems much more common here than in
western europe in general), and I booked hotel in Cēsis, there were campsites,
but, well, I could book a relatively cheap hotel (€30) with breakfast and
get a good nights sleep (hopefully).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/3.JPG" alt="Sigulda" /></p>

<p><em>Sigulda</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow the weather hopes to be better, and I will ride to Valka/Valga - the
twin cities separated by the Latvian / Estonian border, where I will endevour
to stay in a hostel (there seems to be at least one), after that the next stop
is Tartu,</p>
