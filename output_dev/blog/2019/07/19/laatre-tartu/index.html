             <div>
                 <p>As predicted I slept terribly, falling initially to sleep but soon waking up
as my head wasn't comfortable (it was supported inappropriately on my hoody which
was in turn supported by my food pannier). As usual when I realised that it
was morning and I could get <em>out</em> of bed, falling to sleep was no longer an
issue and I didn't wake until 9am. So I slept badly <em>and</em> got out of bed late.</p>

<p>I washed the remnants of last week's breakfast from the pots and pans and
cooked porridge, and ate the rest of the cheese slices.</p>

<p>The previous night I found and phoned ahead to the "Looming" hostel in Tartu,
and this morning I was surprised to find it already bookmarked on my map -- I
think somebody must have recommended it to me in another hostel, although I
don't remember it.</p>

<p>It attracted me as it was a so-called "art" hostel, and looked good, although
on <code>hostelworld.com</code> the beds for both 6 and 12 room dorms were advertised at
€30. I thought this must have been a mistake, and when I checked the website
they were advertised at €17/€18. So I phoned and got those prices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/1.JPG" alt="Quiet" /></p>

<p><em>Quiet road with cycle path, group of school children running on cycle path in
far distance</em></p>

<p>There was a cycle route all the way to Tartu, with distances regularly marked,
but there seemed to be a discrepancy, as I estimated 80k to the city, but the
cycle path said 108k. On checking it made a significant detour, which I was
able to avoid, infact I ended up doing the last 10k on the main road.</p>

<p>In general the cycle paths were very good, and even the gravel sections were
fine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/2.JPG" alt="Drive-by" /></p>

<p><em>Riding past a lake</em></p>

<p>After 40k I stopped for lunch, and found some "real" bread in the supermarket,
albeit bread with raisins in it, but it was freshly baked and tasted good.</p>

<p>At one section a primary school class and accompanying adults seemed to be
running down the cycle path, and three older boys (who presumably started
before the 5 year olds) were overtaking them running at a good pace and I
wondered if running is a part of physical education here, or just a special
event. There were also more than a few people with cruising on the paths with
"dry skis" (skis with roller-blades), something I never saw in
Latvia/Lithuania.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/4.JPG" alt="Panorama of field" /></p>

<p><em>finds panorama mode on camera</em></p>

<p>The MP3 player backlight has now completely gone, but I was somehow able to
put it into random mode, and listened to a good random selection of songs for
the few hours prior to arriving in Tartu by the aforementioned, busy, main
road - although I did manage to turn off before hitting the center by crossing
a railway track.</p>

<p>The hostel seems good, if a little expensive (although I think it's average
here in Estonia). There is no free breakfast, or free coffee, but they do have
a strong ideology, everything (decoration, furniture) in the hostel is made
from recycled/second-hand materials, and they are keen on you minimising waste
and the hostel's ecological footprint etc. They have a large terrace (which is
worryingly next to the dorm, but they have a 11:00 quiet rule) and the bunk
beds are sturdy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/5.JPG" alt="Rebase" /></p>

<p><em>Always advocating git rebase</em></p>

<p>One guy in my room was at the Metallica concert - the old man at the campsite
yesterday evening had mentioned that there was a concert in Tartu, and that
consequently all the chalets and beds were booked out (the campsite was 80km
away from the concert).</p>

<p>I did some work for a few hours, and then went in search of a pizza and beer.
I found a Pizza place and sat down, ordered a beer, but the waiting time for
Pizza was 60 minutes, so I opted to order pasta instead, which is a shame as
the pizzas here look really good, and the pasta I could have happily made that
myself and it would have tasted the same.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/6.JPG" alt="Freight train" /></p>

<p><em>Freight train</em></p>

<p>I think I'll stay here for another night, it seems to be around 300km to
Tallinn, which would presumably be my next "rest" stop and I have around 10
days left.</p>

<p>The title of this blog is "Berlin to Helsinki" but originally it was to
"Tallinn", the only reason it was to Helsinki was because I intended to get
the ferry back, but the ferry will cost at least €250, not including the €50
crossing to Helsinki, and the €100 for trains from Kiel to Berlin. The
alternatives are bus (27 hours) or plane, both of which will require me to
pack my bike, but after getting some bike-packing tips from Stefan (wrap it in
clingfilm and cardboard for the sharp bits) I think this shouldn't be too much
of a problem.</p>
