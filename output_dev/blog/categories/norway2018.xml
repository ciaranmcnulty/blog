            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am now sitting on my cheap Ikea office chair typing this blog post on my
desk in my apartment in Berlin.</p>

<p>This morning I woke first naturally at 4:30am, and then was woken again by the alarm clock
on my phone at 5am. I raised myself in my sleeping bag and unzipped the panel
which opens onto the "porch" of my tent. I had no muesli today, but had good
bread, and I pasted it with jam and had my coffee and read the one day old news
on my phone (there was no Wifi at the campsite).</p>

<p>I was advised to be at the ferry port at 6:30am for the 7:30am sailing, but I
wanted to be there at 6am to give myself some breathing space. I was only 2km
from the ferry port, and I left the campsite at 5:50am, and arrived at around
6:10am.</p>

<p>I was told that I could wait in "here" in the lounge or outside and at 7am
somebody would "open the gate". I said I would wait outside assuming there was
another lounge, but upon investigation it was just a fence with a gate, and I
returned to the lounge and waited with some other passengers.</p>

<p>A man in a high-vis jacket came in and started ushering people towards the
door, he consulted the girl at the check-in and she pointed at me and he
beckoned me to come too and I was allowed to put my bike on the bus which
drove onto the ferry.</p>

<p>I wasn't 100% sure that I was heading to the correct ferry, as we were driving
towards a ferry with "Sassnitz" written in large letters on its hull, but we
passed it and drove up a ramp towards a ferry with no discernible writing on
the side, but given there were only two sailings I was happy to assume this
was the Rostock ferry.</p>

<p>The bus driver waved me towards the end of the ferry and I free-wheeled my
bike in that direction and another ferry operative made arm gestures towards
the other bikes and I made the same arm gesture back and nodded. There were
several bikes tied to the bars at the front of the car deck. There were no
more "ties" however, so I just parked my bike with the kick-stand and made my
way to the stairs.</p>

<p>After being lost for several minutes in the corridors and car levels I found
my way to some of the passenger lounges. People were already there sleeping on
the floor, some had brought duvets up from their cars. I suppose some people
must have had a very early start or may not have even slept at all. One of the
rooms smelt very badly of sewage, which is a shame as it was the room with the
most comfortable chairs.</p>

<p>People were by this time helping themselves to breakfast, I got myself a
coffee and a chocolate muffin and sat down and worked on my software project
for a while, there was free Wifi, even if it was very slow indeed. I had a
missed (whats-app) call from my mother which I only noticed when I connected
to the Wifi, and I rang her. She was still sleeping, I didn't consider that it
was 6am in England.</p>

<p>I did some reading on the ferry, and dozed a bit and worked a bit. We got into
Rostock at around 13:30, making it a six hour crossing.</p>

<p>I had checked the train times on the internet before leaving the ferry and the
next one was at 14:30, I had an hour to get to the train station, buy a ticket
and get on the train. There was no absolute pressure, as the next was at
16:30, but I'd rather avoid the wait, so I made haste on the 10 ride to
Rostock HBF (train station).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_132119.jpg" alt="Sailing into Rostock" /></p>

<p><em>Sailing into Rostock</em></p>

<p>By the time I had found the ticket office and purchased my tickets (~€35 for
me, ~€5 for the bike) I still had 10 minutes to spare. To access the tracks
there were stairs, or a lift. There was a queue for the lift, a queue of four
bicycles, and it seemed to be one biycle at a time. I queued for a few
minutes, and then lost patience and decided to carry my bike down the stairs.</p>

<p>When I lifted the bike it seemed much lighter then I remember. This may have
been because the water bottles were almost empty, or perhaps somehow I have
become stronger in my arms despite doing all my exercise with my legs, or
perhaps I have left something important and heavy behind - but it was easy
work taking it down and then up the stairs to platform eight where I immediately
saw the bicycle carriage.</p>

<p>There were already several bicycles in the carriage, and I added mine to the
mess. The train was very busy. I took my baggage off and found the next
available seat in the adjacent carriage, where I could just about see my
bike.</p>

<p>I didn't really secure it, as doing so would have made the bikes under mine
somewhat inaccessible and was made nervous when I saw a toddler walking up and
down between the bicycles, and playing with my pedals - the little shit
derailed my chain - but I was more worried about the train going around a
corner and the bicycle falling on him. So I went up to check it was stable,
and it was - and the father of the child said "It doesn't move, it's perfect".</p>

<p>I didn't do much at all in the 3 hour journey in the packed train, more and
more passengers and bicycles kept piling in as we went. As we approached
Berlin there were four different stations, the second was the HBF (central train
station), but the first I didn't recognize. Five minutes before we arrived I
searched on my phone I realised the first would be closer to my flat, so I
hastily collected my four panniers (hanging them around my neck and arms) and
shuffled my way towards the bicycle carriage, displacing people along the way.
There were four bikes piled on top of mine now (which had made it's way to the
back). Fortunately there were people on hand to help me out and as I wheeled
my bike onto the platform the toddler-father handed me the last of my panniers
and smiled "good luck" and I smiled back "Danke".</p>

<p><em>Berlin Gesundbrunner</em></p>

<p>As I exited the station I recognized the place, although I had only been there
once and that was on a run. In short time I was at my building. I almost
forgot about my keys, I had removed them from my key fob and put them in my
handle-bar basket, they were fortunately still there, although they had rusted
somewhat.</p>

<p>I wheeled the bicycle into the corridor and hauled the bags off and heaved
them up the 4 flights of stairs, then went back down for the bike, which was
just in front of the mail boxes. I looked at my mail box and it was packed
absolutely full of junk mail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_174009.jpg" alt="Junk Mail" /></p>

<p><em>My Junk Mail</em></p>

<p>It's probably like this in every city, but the local Netto supermarket sends a
full fucking catalog to every single mailbox every single week, and then there
are miscellaneous other tree crimes, but the catalog is the worst. I had been
meaning to put a "No Junk Mail Please" sign on the box, and decided to do it
now while I had a pen and paper.</p>

<p>After bringing the bike up the stairs I opened the door. I was half expecting
an infestation of fruit-flies. I had mismanaged my garbage and the little
shits had started hatching and I was trying to get rid of them when I left. My
last tactic was to leave several bowls of red-wine around the flat. I'm not
sure if that worked (the red wine had dried out and there were numerous dark
spots, which may have been the flies) but in any case they were all gone (save
one which I found in my shower).</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-20/IMG_20180720_175126.jpg" alt="Bike in Room" /></p>

<p><em>New Exhibition Piece</em></p>

<p>After depositing my bike, I went to the supermarket and got supplies - bread,
shower gel (I used my last drops the night before), honey, soya-milk, nuts,
other stuff, and a 6-pack of Störtebecker beer (with multiple varieties). I
already had a four-cheese pizza in my freezer.</p>

<p>Being back in the flat is an anti-climax. I was looking forward to being home,
but at the same time I wasn't. Being on the road there is always an aim to
each day - and a larger aim (e.g. get to Trondheim, return to Berlin) and
everything between the start of the day and the end of the day is an adventure
towards that aim.</p>

<p>Being on the road, you kind of forecast your future each day. You decide
that in 2 weeks you will be in this geographic location, and today you might
be somewhere in this area, and you might possibly stay at this place. In
between A and B anything can happen. The only thing that is almost guaranteed
is that you will have exhausted yourself by the days end and feel good about
it, even if, after the seventh hour you felt dreadful and every kilometer
seems like the previous ten. After an arduous day nothing is more satisfying
than well-deserved sleep.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm in a campsite in Trelleborg, the town on the southern coast of Sweden and
the ferry port. I just showered and hand-washed my underwear and shirt which
are now hanging out to dry.</p>

<p>I got out of bed a later today, both because I had relatively late night and
because I was in no hurry, I only had 15km to Gothenburg and then it was a
train and another short ride to Trelleborg. So I had my tent packed up by
around 9:30am.</p>

<p>My neighbours on the tightly packed campsite were a cycling <em>family</em> from
Germany, and an old couple who were touring in their SUV. They had a tent
mounted on the roof rack which opened out and provided shelter by the side of
the car.</p>

<p>The man from the roof-tent SUV approached me and started talking to be in
German, they were heading to the Atlantic Road on the North coast of Norway
west of Trondheim (which I cycled down). We talked about my journey back to
Berlin and he mentioned that there were other options for the Ferry, notably
that there was a ferry to Rostock.</p>

<p>While I was talking I found myself slipping into French, "Ja, ja mais.." "Ja
das ist so, donc errr..". I am reasonably fluent in French, less so in German,
confident in neither. But whenever I speak in another language I always seem
to unconsciously fill in the gaps with French.</p>

<p>I checked this on the Wifi before leaving the campsite, and there was a
sailing at around 15:30. I still hadn't decided on a plan. The trains from
both Rostock and Sassnitz to Berlin stopped at around 22:00, so if I had taken
a later ferry I would have had to have stayed in a hotel, or found a campsite
that would admit me at that time. Hotels in Sassnitz are very expensive (€100+
a night), Rostock would probably have been cheaper but there was also a
campsite in Trelleborg about 2km from the ferry port, so I could also stay the
night and get the early ferry, which would probably be the cheapest option. So
knowing I had some options, I hit the road.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_091648.jpg" alt="Tesla Charging Points" /></p>

<p><em>There are a huge number of Tesla car charging stations in Norway and Sweden</em></p>

<p>Looking back I realised there was a large ruined castle opposite the campsite.</p>

<p>It was plain sailing to Gothenburg, although slightly longer than I expected,
it was around 20k in total. Riding into the city I passed though lots of
industrial areas and construction sites, there was a cycle path all of the
way, although sometimes it was diverted due to the construction works.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_101329.jpg" alt="Crossing the Bridge" /></p>

<p><em>Crossing the Bridge in Gothenburg</em></p>

<p>I didn't stick around and headed straight to the central train station and got
a ticket to Malmo (pronounced "Mal-ma") with the bike. The ticket for <em>me</em> cost
around €60, and the bike another €28 (the same price as a child). When I
bought the ticket the girl behind the counter said that the train left in 10
minutes, which made me think I might miss it, but the ticket was valid for all
trains, so there was no absolute pressure.</p>

<p>As it turned out the train was about a 1 minute walk away and was already at
the station. I pulled my bike onto the first carriage, as there were folding
seats and space for a bike, but I noticed there were no bicycle signs, I asked
a passenger if he spoke English, and then if he knew if this was the correct
place for a bicycle "I have no idea" he said apologetically, hmm. I stood in
open doorway and scanned for a conductor, then noticed a layout plan for the
train in a frame on the wall, it clearly indicated that cycles go in the
middle carriage, so I pulled the bike out and walked further down the platform
and saw a carriage very clearly marked with a bicycle logo.</p>

<p>I pulled my bike inside and there were 3 other bikes already there and a
push-chair. I pulled my bike inside and sat down on one of a row of folding seats
opposite the bicycles. There was a woman and her toddler next to me. As we
pulled away the toddler came up and leaned on my arm, and that embraced it
"Hello" I said. The woman smiled and pulled him away. A few minutes later he
came up again and hugged my leg and of course everybody laughed at how sweet
it was and the woman pulled had to separate him from me.</p>

<p>I was quite tired and dozed off on the train, I read for a little while, and
tried to do some work on my laptop, but was unable to do much as I required
the internet.</p>

<p>It was around 2 hours until we arrived in Malmo. Walking out of the train
station I was greeted by a lively aesthetic square, as I cycled thorugh the
town I reflected on how nice the city was, but I made my way out and rode
straight to Trelleborg.</p>

<p>My optimistic first estimate of the distance was 10, I think I estimated
this a week ago and never revised it, but it was more like 30km. Fortunately
there was a strong tail-wind and I made fast progress, at one point nearly
hitting 40kmph on the flat, a speed that would not impress a racing cyclist,
but on a touring bicycle it's pretty fast.</p>

<p>As I cycled towards the ferry port I passed two youths, one of which spat as I
cycled past and then I could here them jeering behind me. It might have been
my imagination, but it made me angry. I rode on. This is the second time I've
been provoked, the first time was a couple of days ago when a car beeped at me
for no other reason than that I was cycling on the road in a shopping center
car park, after passing me he accelerated his cheap pseudo-sports car in an
aggressive way. Prior to this I had not had any cars beep at me (except a
single lorry and that was justifiable).</p>

<p>I found the ferry port, and went inside and asked about "boats to Germany".
There were sailings today, but they were full. Tomorrow there were sailings to
Sassnirz and Rostock at 07:30 and 07:45 respectively. I booked the 07:45 to
Rostock and decided to make my way to the campsite.</p>

<p>On the way I found a cycle shop. The clerk was in the middle of selling a new
pair of bicycles to an older couple and I had to wait about 10 minutes, but
eventually I got myself a working pump and a new inner tube from the affable
man. I'm not planning to cycle any more long distances before getting back to
Berlin, so probably won't need them, but there is always a chance I will end
up cycling some or all of the way to Berlin if I can't get a train ticket
tomorrow. It's not over until it's over!</p>

<p>The campsite is a pretty large one, and at the reception I payed the highest
price so far, I think it translated to around €20. The shower and kitchen are
included in the price, but there is no Wifi at all. This is annoying, as I am
now unable to (conveniently) further plan for tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-19/IMG_20180719_181844.jpg" alt="The Campsite" /></p>

<p><em>The Campsite</em></p>

<p>So I have an early start, I plan to be at the ferry port at around 6am, so
want to get up at around 5am. Will probably get into Rostock at around 11am -
and then the plan is to get the train to Berlin - but bicycle spaces are
limited, so will just play it by ear.</p>

<p>At the very least, I will be glad to be in Germany again, and have use of my
mobile internet, be able to withdraw cash and use my card without surcharges
and return to my normal economy.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another troublesome day with the bike.</p>

<p>As I settled down in my tent last night there was a group of four or five
teenagers in the tent next to mine who were talking and laughing until
midnight, and somehow, although they were not being overly loud, managed to
annoy me as I was trying to read. At 4:30am there was a crash of thunder (but
no rain) which woke me up, and I guess most other people on the campsite
including my neighbors, but they were the only ones who decided to chat about
it for half-an-hour.</p>

<p>The temperature is better at night now, probably because I am further south,
but perhaps also owing to the weather. Today was also hot, but with lots of
humidity too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_090719.jpg" alt="133k" /></p>

<p><em>133k (but think this was the motorway distance)</em></p>

<p>Before leaving the campsite I tried to use the internet and investigate a
possible hostel in Gothenburg and check the train and ferry times, but the
connection was awful, and I gave up, deciding instead to head to a campsite in
Kungalv, which is 10 from the city. I'm hoping I will be able to make the
complete jounrey back to Berlin tomorrow - getting the train from Gothenburg
to Malmo, then cycling to Trelleborg to get the ferry - but as yet I still
don't know when the boat sails or how much it will cost.</p>

<p>It was going to be a longish journey, at least 133km, more like 150 to the
city itself, but the terrain is relatively flat, so I was able to make good
time, following the motorway with the minor roads.</p>

<p>I stopped in a Swedish supermarket, the prices seem somewhat cheaper than
Norway, but it's difficult to be sure as I don't know the conversion rate.
Both countries use the term "Krona" but they are different currencies, but I
believe the conversion rate is similar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_103140.jpg" alt="Lumps" /></p>

<p><em>Lumps</em></p>

<p>There was a slightly different selection of food, and I got a small
ready-to-eat garlic baguette and a pastry, a bar of chocolate a can of
beans and an onion.</p>

<p>The sky was stormy and as I approached the city of Uddevala there were gusts
of wind and very dark clouds and the occasional clap of thunder and lightning
and then it started raining, but not very hard. I had covered about 70km when
I sat down for lunch on a bench in the rain.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_093401.jpg" alt="Swedish Milestone" /></p>

<p><em>Swedish Milestone</em></p>

<p>After navigating out of the city, and riding about 10km I had a puncture. The
first puncture of this tour. An inconvenience, but also a coincidence, could
it really be unrelated to the problems I had yesterday?</p>

<p>I pulled up and removed the wheel and the inner tube. I partially inflated the
tube, held it in front of my upper lip and rotated it (the lip is sensitive
enough to detect the escaping air). I couldn't find anything on the outside,
so I inverted it and checked the inside. There was a puncture on the inside
next to the valve.</p>

<p>I soon realized my mistake - when I changed the wheel yesterday, I didn't put
any tape around the inside of the wheel. The wheel is punctuated by holes for
the spokes, and without tape the inner-tube can rub against the metal edges of
the holes. This is how the puncture happened.</p>

<p>I didn't have any tape, but I had a length of material which, while not
surrounding the whole wheel, would cover maybe 30% of it, which might do for
the remainder of the journey.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_160258.jpg" alt="Makeshift Rim-tape" /></p>

<p><em>Makeshift Rim-tape</em></p>

<p>The puncture was near the valve, which is unfortunate as it was near a ridge.
I roughed up  area down, applied a repair-patch, held it there for a minute
and then re-inflated the tire and started putting the wheel on. It is an
energy consuming process, so I was more than a bit pissed off when I heard the
air suddenly rushing out as I secured the wheel. Off it came again! I decided
to use my spare inner tube.</p>

<p>The spare inner tube had a different valve, but that was fine because my pump
could be converted to that valve, I went to put some air in it, but the pump
didn't work - the pump was broken. It worked for the "french" valve, but not
the car valve. I couldn't use my spare inner tube.</p>

<p>I tried again to repair the other inner tube, and paid special attention to
try and make it stick as best as possible on the ridge near the valve, I was
pretty sure it wouldn't hold out long, but maybe, maybe it would.</p>

<p>I got the wheel on, and inflated the tire to a reasonable pressure and started
off - if I could get 20km from it, then I could reasonably walk or run the
remaining 20km. But it didn't last 20km, it lasted about 10km. I couldn't fix
it so now I was walking.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_100546.jpg" alt="Grind" /></p>

<p><em>Grind</em></p>

<p>I walked past a house, and could see some people. The house was actually under
construction and the people I could see were builders, I walked up the drive
way and waved, but they didn't have a pump.</p>

<p>I carried on, it was 5km to the next village, which was an hours walk. I took
off my sandals and put my trainers on and began to jog with the bike, doubling
my speed (at least). I looked around at the houses I passed to see if I could
see anybody, or if I could see a house with bikes outside. There were quite a
few houses, but I didn't want to invest my time walking up drive ways and
knocking on doors only to find that nobody was home or they didn't have a
pump.</p>

<p>Eventually I saw a house with a garage and van outside, and a man was in the
van. I made my way towards him and waved and he waved back.</p>

<p>"Svenska? Engelsk? English?" "English" I replied. "Where are you from?"
"Weymouth" and he looked confused. I thought for some reason that our first
question identified my country not my language. "If you go south from Bristol
to the coast you are there, but I live in Berlin".</p>

<p>I don't think I even mentioned what the problem was before he said with an
Australian twang "You've come to the right place, bring the bike into the
garage"</p>

<p>He walked around and opened the garage doors. It was a large workshop with two
motor-cross motorcycles, loads of tools, a car and a few bikes.
He offered me a shower and even offered to wash my clothes and give me a lift</p>

<p>to the town I was headed to (where he happened to work). He spoke in an
Australian accent and had spent two and half years in Australia, originally
intending to go there for 3 months.</p>

<p>He helped me get the tire off and found some tape to wrap around the inside of
the wheel, and helped me put the tire back on the wheel (I was struggling and
mentioned that sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard, he pointed out
that the tire was not tucked in on the other side, and when that was fixed the
tire fit easily). He offered me a cold, non-alcoholic beer which I accepted</p>

<p>I don't think I could have found a better house to call on. His name was
Daniel and he is a carpenter, mechanic and a motocross champion and was
preparing his bike for a tournament at the weekend.</p>

<p>After finishing my beer I took my leave, it wished me luck with my journey and
I wished him luck with his tournament.</p>

<p>To think, all of the problems I have had over the past two days have been
because of a snapped gear cable and not trimming the end of the replacement.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-18/IMG_20180718_120845.jpg" alt="Riding by the motorway" /></p>

<p><em>Riding by the motorway</em></p>

<p>I cycled onwards, I still had about 50k to cover. I managed to stay mostly on
quiet roads. Daniel showed me where I could find a bike shop (or a massive
super store that sells just about everything) - I still need to buy a new pump
and a new replacement inner tube. But I decided instead to head straight to
the camping. I have only 10k to do tomorrow, and am feeling confident that the
bike will hold up.</p>

<p>All of this time I thought it was earlier than it was, and was getting to the
campsite at 18:00, I pulled in but couldn't see the reception, so I asked a
man coming out the kitchen - "It's round the front, but I think it may be
closed". I thought that strange, as it was only 18:00. They were not closed
and I went in and asked. A young girl said, "I'm not sure we have room, maybe
you can go and have a look, we have tent places here and here" she pointed on
the map and passed it to me.</p>

<p>There was place, but the campsite is really full. There are a number of dogs
in little corrals attached to caravans. On the way in to the town I passed a
huge field full of tents. All the tents were of the same basic form and
ranked close together, it didn't look like a campsite, I wondered if it were a
refugee camp, but the people didn't look like refugees, and then looking
closer I could see the tents largely contained dogs in cages. And between the
tents were obstacle courses. It was some kind of large dog festival.</p>

<p>So the campsite is full, and there is a dog festival. My watch was on "dual
time" - it was two hours behind. But everything is good. The girl just came in
(at 22:30) and offered me a coffee, as they were pouring the last of it down
the drain. I have been left inside the main reception building in a very
comfortable room (I can leave, but the door is locked for re-entry).</p>

<p>Now, after this blog post I need to find out when the trains leave (although I
think they are hourly) and when the ferry leaves, how much it costs, etc.).
Tomorrow I hope to be in Berlin!</p>

<p>18:00-22:15 ferry to Sassnitz from Trelleborg, 99kr</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My bike wheel and derailleur completely destroyed today.</p>

<p>I woke up in the campsite and had 3 helpings of museli and jam and one helping
of coffee, then went to fill my water bottles and wash my pots. I cycled away
in the wrong direction but quickly realised my error and doubled back.</p>

<p>Again, the cycle route was not direct and I just stuck as closely to the
motorway (which goes directly to Gothenburg) as possible. There are minor
roads zig-zagging along side it.</p>

<p>It was only 10km to the border with Sweden and I was soon there. I didn't see
any sign explictly saying "Welcome to Sweden", but there was a bridge crossing
a river which seems to act as the border. Before crossing I went in to a
"Boutik" to try and spend some of my Norwegian kronas, but couldn't really
think of anything to buy - so I just got a loaf of bread and a pastry. I sat
down and ate the pastry, which was dry and disapointing, and I assumed the
same of the bread, but as it turned out the bread was pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_100240.jpg" alt="Bridge over the border" /></p>

<p><em>Bridge Over Bordered Waters</em></p>

<p>So then I was in Sweden, and again I was following the motorway rather than
the cycle route. On my map the road is coloured white - which <em>usually</em> means
that its a very minor country road, but actually it seems to be the old main
road. It was suffering a little from lack of maintainence, and there were
derelict rest areas and abandonned restaurants and shops along the route.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_101824.jpg" alt="Flags Flying" /></p>

<p><em>Flags Flying</em></p>

<p>I made pretty good progress in good time, as most of the terrain was flat,
when the terrain was not flat, I was careful not to strain my gears too much.</p>

<p>At around 12 I started looking for a place to have lunch, but couldn't find
any benches or anywhere to sit down, so I just carried on, aiming to hit the
town I now know is "Tanumshede". On the way I listened to Tom Waits, and was
quietly singing along to the "Rain Dogs".</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_123252.jpg" alt="Bjork" /></p>

<p><em>Bjork</em></p>

<p>About 10km from the town, when I was riding up a minor hill, my gears crunched
and then I couldn't pedal anymore. The pedals would not move and a lorry
(which happened to be passing, the road was not busy) beeped at me as I was
somewhat further into the road than I would have like to have been when I
"lost power".</p>

<p>I turned round and manuvoured my bike to the side of the road and had a look.
The problem was that when I changed the cable yesterday, the cable was too
long and I didn't have any wire cutters to remove the end, so I just left it
"sticking out". Somehow this loose end had become entangled in the chain and
run itself into the derailleur, after disentangling the cable the gears were
still not right, and I couldn't figure out <em>why</em>. The derailleur was at a
wrong angle, so I just use brute force and bent it into an angle where the
chain would pass.</p>

<p>This solution worked, it was worse than before, but I could still cycle and I
made it to the town. My mission was still to find somewhere to eat - and it
was <em>really</em> hot, I had already gone through both my water bottles and half of
my 1.5 liter backup bottle. The water in both my bottles was warm. I
eventually (it wasn't easy) found a bench in the town and sat down and had a
can of baked beans and some of the actually quite good bread.</p>

<p>A diverse range of people walked passed me, a pensioner with a walking frame,
an African kid on a bike, a Muslim family and some young kids making strange
noises. This diversity was also very common in Norway, though not, peculiarly,
in Denmark.</p>

<p>I decided to pedal on, and made my way back to the main street and started
cycling down it, I noticed another touring bicycle parked outside a Thai
restaurant, and wondered if it was one of the couples I had already met on my
journey, and then CRACK!</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_145347.jpg" alt="Disaster Wheel" /></p>

<p><em>Catastrophic Bike Failure</em></p>

<p>My chain slipped and there was a crunch of gears and my bike was completely
immobile. I said "SHIT!". I got off and inspected the damage. It was a
disaster. The derailleur itself had bent back and become entangled in the
wheel spokes, and had broken several of them. I stood looking at this mess for
about 5 minutes and it slowly began to realise that I would not be able to fix
this, at least not completely. There was little to no chance I could fix the
derailleur - so my priority was just making the bike mobile again.</p>

<p>I removed the broken spokes, but the wheel would not turn. It was buckled and
the mud guard was obstructing it's rotation. If I removed the mud guard the
wheel might be able to rotate. The mud guard was attached with bolts - and I
didn't have any tool to unscrew them - luckily they were loose and I was able
to unscrew them with my fingers, it was still affixed, more firmly with braces
attached to the forks, which I could not remove, but without the other two
screws the mudguard was loose enough to allow the wheel to pass.</p>

<p>Whilst I was engaged in this, I realised I needed a bike engineer. I asked a
passing woman if she knew of a bike shop "I had a problem with my bike the
other day, and there is a shopping center, I will show you where" ".. and
there is an Intersport there". I thanked her, and when my bike was mobile
again I jogged with it (about 3km) to the shopping center. I didn't dare put
my weight on the wheel and risk buckling it even more.</p>

<p>At the shopping center there was no "Intersport" but there was a "Sport" shop,
I left my bike outside and went in and found the shop, they did indeed sale
bikes, but when I asked if they did repairs "No, we don't do that" "Do you
know a place that does?" "err, yes. You can go to Westmanns, I will show you
where" and I showed me where on my phone.</p>

<p>I jogged then to this shop which was another kilometer or so, I jogged because
it was already around 15:00 and wanted to maximise my chances of having it
fixed today.</p>

<p>"Do you do repairs? Could you fix my bike?" "err, yes, But not today, we have
20 bike repairs queued" I said it was somewhat of an emergency and he said he
would ask the engineer, who came out of the workshop and looked at the bike.</p>

<p>"I have the parts, but I don't have the time to fix it, but there is another
man in town who does bicycle repairs, he has a workshop in his garage" he said
he would ring him for me. He rang, and he rang but there was no answer. He
then said, "well, you could wait here and we could ring again, or this is his
card, he lives only 700m down the road". I decided to visit his house.</p>

<p>When I got there I knew it was the right place because the house had
"Sykelrepairs" (or similar) written above the garage, I rang the door bell and
there was some commotion inside and it was answered by an Asian older woman and a
young girl and an old girl. "Hi!" "Hello!" "Do you speak English" the woman
looked confused and looked towards her youngest daughter (who was maybe 10)
for help, she didn't speak perfect English but communicated enough "She it not
here, she at work" (I think she meant He, his name was Tolbörg) but come back
after 17:00. "Maybe tomorrow?" "No also work tomorrow". I thanked them and
walked back to the bicycle shop.</p>

<p>As I was walking it struck me that I could perform the repair myself if I had
the parts, and I looked at the bike and then at the sprockets then remembered
that I would need to transfer the sprockets onto the new wheel, and I had no
tool to do that (and I didn't even know how), but I could probably fit the
derailleur myself, so I went back to propose a plan "I don't know how
time-intensive it is, but maybe if you could change the sprocket onto a new
wheel I could do the rest myself?". The mechanic didn't look like he thought I
could and was trying to tell me something, but his English wasn't to good.</p>

<p>In the end, he said. If you take the wheel off, then I'll change the sprocket,
then you can change the tire and inner tube and mount the wheel on the bike,
then call me back.</p>

<p>This done, I went to call him, but there were five customers, the guy was
dreadfully busy. When they had left he came out and looked at the bike and
noticed that not only was the derailleur broken (we couldn't tell how) but the
frame (or at least the part of the frame holding the derailleur was bent). He
had a tool to fix it, and he bent it back into shape, but the derailleur still
didn't act correctly (every time it shifted up, it veneered straight into the
spokes again).</p>

<p>He analysed it and tried to figure out how to save it, there was probably some
way to bend it back into shape again. I wonder if the initial problem was the
bent frame, and if I had broken the derailleur by bending it into position, or
if I had bent the frame. But regardless, the guy thought that the derailleur
was savable "Could it be fixed?" "Everything can be fixed, it's just a
question of time and money". We decided to fit a new derailleur. He didn't
have the exact one required, but had something close, he showed it to me and
waited. "So, shall I just fix it on there?" "It will be better if I take the
bike into my workshop". So he did, and I stood and watched him as he nimbly
fitted the new derailleur, and even removed some links on my stretched chain
and did his best to tune the gears: "It's not great, but it's OK. You haven't
got all gears, but you have some."</p>

<p>I was very grateful to him. In the end he probably spent an hour or more of
his time helping me. He charged me for the wheel and the derailleur but
wouldn't charge for his labour. If he hadn't have helped me I'm not sure what
I would have done, but it's likely I would be stuck in the town for at least
another day.</p>

<p>I chucked the destroyed wheel into the skip and cycled onto the towns campsite
(which was just 1km down the road). My bike still needs some looking at - the
mud guards need re-fixing, and the rear break no longer seems to work (though
I don't think it's serious).</p>

<p>The replacement wheel is just a mountain bike wheel, and the derailleur is not
as good as the one it replaced. The back wheel is a slight concern as it has
to hold quite a bit of weight (the older one was purposely heavy and strong),
but I think it will get me to Gothenburg, though not so sure it would survive
a repeat of this tour.</p>

<p>I arrived at the campsite covered in oil. I have no Swedish cash only card,
and asked if I could "buy" some cash, he replied "only for the shower". I
needed a shower "How many showers do you need?" I should have said fifty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-17/IMG_20180717_200958.jpg" alt="Pea Soup" /></p>

<p><em>Improved Pea Soup</em></p>

<p><em>PEA SOUP</em>: Before leaving the campsite I took some of my dried peas and put
them in a container with water. They doubled in size and looked like frozen
peas. The aim was to make a thick pea soup - but after 45 minutes of cooking
they were soft enough to eat, but not mushy, and not a creamy soup. But a big
improvement on my last attempt.</p>

            <id>/blog/2018/07/16/oslo-skjeberg/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The middle aged man on the bunk oppsite to me got out of bed at around 5am, I
woke up and dozed intermitently before getting out of bed at around 7am and
packing my stuff up. I hoped that the hostel had a kitchen where I could make
my breakfast. I went down with my bags and asked at reception "Do you have a
kitchen?" "Only the ones in the rooms". And I thought: fine, I'll go back to the
dormitory where everybody is sleeping and make a full-english then. I'm always
a bit puzzled when hostels put equipment in a dormitory which can only
negatively effect it's purpose: for people to sleep. TVs and bathrooms are bad
enough (people pulling the flush or having a shower at 3am) but I've never
seen a kitchen before.</p>

<p>With the kitchen not being an option, I sat down in the reception and pulled
out some of my camping gear and poured the last of my museli into the camping
pot and added water and jam. I thought I would bolster myself with a last shop
in Norway on the way out of Oslo. I was actually pretty hungry - as I had only
had a sandwich for dinner the previous night.</p>

<p>I packed up my stuff and walked around with my bags to the hotel next door
where my bike was stored. Loaded it up and walked out onto the street and took
check of myself: Both my water bottles were half full, I hadn't been to the
toilet and I was hungry. Not the best way to set out, but I set out anyway and
cycled south, trying to cut into the center of Oslo to have a look about, but
didn't stay long or see anything of particular interest.</p>

<p>The sun was shining and the sky was clear, and it was not cold at all. I
headed to the town of Ski. There is a cycle route to Gothenburg (as found on
the Eurovelo website and on my phone) but it is not at all direct, and looked
very hard to follow. I started by following the route, but was always ready to
hop onto the main road to bypass lengthly, cycle-friendly, detours.</p>

<p>The terrain was refreshingly flat for most of the day.</p>

<p>First stop was a supermarket. I was looking for green-lentils. Actually, I
have been looking for green lentils since the second week in Norway. I had
some from Denmark which lasted me a good while, but perculiarly I cannot find
<em>any</em> in Norway. Well, they have lentils, but they have no <em>dried</em> lentils of
any color. This is a shame as that's basically my protien.</p>

<p>So, I got only another can of baked beans, some bread, a pastry, and, possibly
a mistake, but a bar of choclate.</p>

<p>This was my first bar of chocolate on this tour. I think on my first tour I
ate two or three big bars a day and put on weight. Chocolate is (for me at
least) highly addictive. It is also a good source of energy, as I was feeling
depleted I decided to indulge myself with a €2.50 (the cheapest) bar of
chocolate. I think it helped, but as I was cycling my mind kept thinking of
the bar of chocolate and how I should stop and eat some. I managed to save
enough during the day to have only just finished the last two peices while
writing this blog post. But I will continue to avoid it.</p>

<p>The same goes for cookies (or any high-sugar snacks) - they taste nice and I
can fool myself into thinking I need it, but I will easily demolish a half
pack in a single sitting even if I told myself I would only take one. So
better to abstain. Instead I will by single-serving pastries to get my sugar
hit.</p>

<p>The previous evenining, while I was leading the Bavarian tandem couple to the
hotel, my chain slipped. It wasn't the first time on this trip, but it was a
sign of things to come today.</p>

<p>The slipping chain has a singular effect on me. Everytime it happens I have a
loud bout of tourrets. It is very discouraging, and sometimes dangerous,
especially when cycling up a hill and your putting your full force into the
pedal, when it slips the pedal flies forward and it's possible to lose your
balance, or for the pedal to go 180 degrees and the opposite pedal to hit your
leg. It happens randomly when you least expect it and means that you have to
approach steep inclines in a very cautious way.</p>

<p>The chain continued slipping today, until the gear stopped working altogether
and the chain rested on the bottom rung and wouldn't budge.</p>

<p>A quick investigation revealed that the cable had snapped and I pulled the
frailed end out of the gear changer on the handle bar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-16/IMG_20180716_111541.jpg" alt="Broken Cable" /></p>

<p><em>Broken Cable</em></p>

<p>This happened two years ago in Slovakia, I think on the other side. Then, I
had no replacement cable and it was a Sunday had to tie the cable to the frame
in order to keep the deraileuer in a single position until the following day.</p>

<p>Fortunately I learnt from that and made sure to buy an extra cable. That extra
cable has been sitting at the bottom of my food-bag for two years, it was
rusty but serviceable.</p>

<p>I spent some time figuring out how to get the cable attached to the
gear-changer. In the end I had to partially dismantle it. There is a "meter"
showing which gear you are in, it was on the bottom part of the changer and
hooks into the mechanism on the upper part. So when I dismantled it, it was
very hard to get it back together again, and consequently it doesn't work
anymore, but not a great loss.</p>

<p>The cable was now replaced, but I didn't bother tuning the gears, which in
hindsight would have been energy well invested, but I left thinking I could
tune them if necessary on my lunch stop. But the gears were completely awful,
and I had to apply pressure to the changers some of the time to stop them
slipping.</p>

<p>About this time I passed a group of three young cyclists, two guys and a girl.
These three were to play a repeated part in the days cycling, as, despite me
stopping mulitple times to fix my bike and have lunch we kept passing one
another. It seems we had the same destination. Around the fourth time there
were smiles as they saw me again and I smiled back, the last time I passed
them they were all three sitting in the shade of a cabin, when they looked up
and saw me they all gave me a big wave and I waved back. I then carried on,
but realised that I had taken the wrong direction, so passed them once more
for the last time.</p>

<p>After making my first road-side coffee (I had no coffee in the morning, so I
pulled out my camping stove in a lay-by) I started to tune my gears. To tune
the gears I turned the whole bike upside down, it probably took around 15
minutes, and seemed much better afterwards, at least for an hour or so. During
this hour I was quite happy, much facilitated by the flat terrain and my new
music.</p>

<p>My MP3 player has around 15 albums on it, but I have listened to them too many
times, but then I remembered seeing a micro-sd card in my luggage and wondered
what was on it. I wasn't sure exactly where it was, but searched the possible
locations and eventually found the finger-nail sized memory card. It was at
least two years since it had last been used and initially my MP3 player
wouldn't accept it, but after some vigorous rubbing and blowing it registered
and I found a little treasure-trove of around 20 albums and rode off listening
to Jefferson Airplane and then The Pogues.</p>

<p>But this period of contentness was interuptted when my gears started making a
abbrasive noise and I stopped (I had actually just pulled in beind the three
young cyclists on my route). I looked at the problem. The front deraileuer
was, on the highest rung, was rubbing bother the back and front of the chain.
I didn't know how this was possible, or what could have changed to cause this
strange state. This made me quite sad as the gears were working so well
previously.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-16/IMG_20180716_173108.jpg" alt="Token Picture" /></p>

<p><em>Token Picture</em></p>

<p>I didn't know what had happened, and the only way I could see to fix it was to
rotate the whole deraileur to a different angle so that the chain passed
through it silently.</p>

<p>The chain continues to slip now and then - I assume its related to the tuning,
but it may well be that the chainset is worn down (it's seen almost 10,000km I
guess) and the two problems are just coinciding.</p>

<p>Today I made my target, and am just 10km away from the Swedish border, from
whence the distance to Gothenburg is around 200 - 230km depending on the
route. Looking forward to more flat terrain and maybe some marginally cheaper
prices in Sweden (maybe I can even afford a can of beer).</p>

<p>I have 150kr remaining, which I was saving in case the campsite required cash,
but they only took card (and it cost 165kr in anycase). So will try and
stock-up in a supermarket before Sweden.</p>

            <updated>2018-07-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2018/07/15/trondheim-oslo/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The hostel provided free coffee in the morning and, as hostels often do, free
food. Free food is food left by other guests, and there was a bag of coffee in
the free food cupboard, which I took advantage of when the morning coffee
wasn't available, I also purchased a bag of coffee for the following days, for
it was now the plan to do at least three more days of cycling.</p>

<p>The plan was: Get the train from Trondheim to Oslo, stay in a hostel, cycle
three days to Gothenburg in Sweden, then get the train to Malmo (on the south
coast) where I could get the ferry to Germany, and from there get a trian (or
two) to Berlin. The reason I have to cycle to Gothenburg is that the swedish
trains do not accept bicycles (unless they are packed as luggage). An internet
rumour has it that this is because of "Security Concerns", although what
these are, I cannot guess.</p>

<p>So I had booked the train and the hostel. The train to Oslo cost around €120
including the bike, and the hostel around €35. There is only limited space on
the trains for bikes, and there seems to be a high demand, as there were
multiple trains and the only one availble for me was the one leaving at 15:30.
So I waited in the hostel until around 14:00 then set out for the near-by
train station.</p>

<p>I made a sandwich for later, but decided to buy lunch anyway, the sandwich
would be dinner. There was precious little in the station shop that was
vegetarian, indeed I havn't seen many vegetarian options anywhere in Norway.
At the counter they had three different types of Calzoni, three types of
sandwich, and two types of pannini. The tomato-mozeralla pannini was the only
vegetarian option.</p>

<p>I put my lunch in my bag and made my way to patform four to get the train. I
noticed a large tandem bicycle and an older couple standing by. I said hello,
and asked them about their journey. They were also getting the train to Oslo.
The train had 2 bicycle compartments, it turned out my bike was in the same
compartment as this couple, but there were two other touring bikes going in
another. So this seems like a popular route home for bicycle-tourers.</p>

<p>I loaded my bicycle and sat down in my allocated seat. I got my laptop out and
started working on my project. The train had power outlets but no Wifi, and I
think I spent about 3 and a half hours working, another hour or two reading,
and the rest of the time staring blankly out of the window, and eventually
listenting to an hour of "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich". The train was
slightly delayed and got into Oslo at around 22:45.</p>

<p>Getting out of the train I walked around to the bicycle carridge and waited
for the cycling-couple to extract their tandem from the train with the help of
the conductor. When we were all unloaded and on the platform I asked where
they were staying "The Anker Hotel" the man said. He was a red-faced, grey
bearded, man from Bavraia with his wife. "Me too" I said, "Oh, then do you
know the way there?" "I think so". They were actually sitting 2 seats behind
me and for the last hours they were chanting the directions to the hotel to
themselves "recht, recht, links, zweiter rechts" etc.We decided to go to the
hostel together.</p>

<p>I led the way using my GPS, unfortunately my map had automatically switched to
night-mode, unfortunate because I rely largely on colors to determine where I
can cycle, and now they had all changed. But I just made assumptions and we
cut through a pedestrian square, passing some revelers "Are you doing the
Tour-de-france?". I thought it was obvious that we were not.</p>

<p>The hotel was less than a kilometer from the train station, upon arival we
parked our bikes outside the glass revolving door and the couple checked in
first, the hotel let them and I put our bikes in the baggage room and gave us
receipts. When I checked in they couldn't find my booking, eventually the
young girl looked up and said "Did you perhaps check in at the hostel?", "Yes!
I did!"</p>

<p>The hostel was just the next building down, but run by the same company, so I
was able to keep my bike in the hotel's baggage room.</p>

<p>In the hostel there was a small number of people queuing at reception, a group
of three americans talking to the barman and me waiting to check in. When I
was served they also couldn't find my booking. They asked if I had my booking
confirmation, I showed it to them, but they seemed less concerned that I had
made an incorrect booking, than that their system was wrong. It took ten
minutes for the receptionist to finally concedede defeat "Can you show me the
booking confirmation again?, I will need to create it from scratch, this
system really pisses me off".</p>

<p>In the male-only eight-bed dormitory room there was a middle aged man reading
on the bed, and an Australian sitting on his bed hunched over his phone. I
took a shower. The bathroom was part of the room, and there was also a
mini-kitchen. It wasn't luxurious, and the bathroom sink at pubic hairs in it.
There was no locker to put my stuff in, so I stuffed my bags (all of them)
under my bed and sat down and read. We were soon joined by another man who sat
on his bed and worked on his laptop. Then the Australian started watching a
video on his phone with the sound on. I read a chapter of my book and then
checked if it was OK to turn out the light, and slept pretty well.</p>

<p>When the girl came around to collect the money for camping, it was actually
very cheap, only 60kr (about €6) - cheapest so far, almost by half.</p>

<p>It was quiet enough and I was initially camping on the tent pitch on my own,
but later joined by two other tents, but they were at a good distance from
each-other and not noisy in any case. There was a small party happening in one
of the caravans on the other side of the site making noise until around 12,
inducing me to put my ear-plugs in as I read three chapters of "Memoirs of a
Geisha". Thankfully the noise stopped at around eleven and I slept well until
the morning.</p>

<p>This morning I used the last both of my coffee and my jam. The coffee has
lasted me all this time from Berlin, and I have been drinking a cup a day
(except in the youth hostels where I used their coffee). The Jam also has
lasted since Germany.</p>

<p>I was only at most 70km from Trondheim, so I was in no hurry to leave the
campsite, but ended up leaving at around nine anyway - if there was a chair
and table where I could sit down and work, I might have stayed, but working in
the tent, with my legs folded and the laptop resting on one of my panniers, is
not super-comfortable, and I always experience stretching pains when I stand-up
after sitting cross-legged after a certain duration.</p>

<p>I left the campsite cycling the wrong way but soon realised my error and
turned back. I was listening to the Manic Street Preachers (Gold Against the
Soul), but then changed to another audio-book. Yesterday I did 4 chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655">Howard
Zinn</a>,
today I did three chapters of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens</a>.
Sapiens is also a history, but a pre-history history. So far telling the tale
of the different genus of "homo" of which we, "sapiens" are only one species
of many which used to exist. Lots of profound ideas.</p>

<p>I stopped at a supermarket ("Coop"). As I stopped I didn't really know
<em>why</em> I had stopped, it has just become a routine to stop at a supermarket
once a day. Once inside I just picked up a pastry and two rolls of bread, and
also was able to use the supermarket guest WiFi. I payed in cash, but debated
buying more stuff and paying with card.</p>

<p>I only have 150kr left in cash now, and about 4 days ago I realised that every
time I drew cash from the cash machine, it charged me €6. I had always tried
to take the minimum amount of cash plausible from the machine as I don't want
to leave the country with too much remaining. But if I'm only taking out €40,
then €6 is a very high surcharge (it seems to be a fixed fee). Using the card
"only" costs around 69 cents. But that makes no sense when buying a few bread
rolls and a cake (€3.75).</p>

<p>The cycle route into Trondheim was pretty quiet, and it was cycle paths all
the way to the center. It is the third most populous city in Norway, but has a
low population of 193,000 compared to more populated countries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Statistics!!!</em></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Number of days: 23</li>
  <li>Distance: 2362.3km</li>
  <li>Average per day: 102.69km</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I got to the hostel I parked my bike outside and went in, the reception
was closed but a girl said "hello" and said "check-in is at 15:00" (it was
around 13:00) but she proceeded to open up the reception anyway, and then
found my booking and let me know that the room was already made up and there
was another person in it (otherwise I could put my bike in the room) and that
I could check-in right-away.</p>

<p>Outside I met an old woman who looked my bike up and down "You checking in
<em>here</em> ?" "Yes. I just checked in" "<em>really</em>?" "err, yeah" "ohh, very lucky,
you are very lucky, they don't let people check in until 15:00".</p>

<p>This old lady seems to be a resident, or part of the staff, I'm not sure. But
she stalks around the place checking that everything is in it's right place
and correcting people continuously so that you are likely to make a mess just
out of spite. But I'm sure she means well. But it's a very different
atmosphere from Bergen, but also the facilities are excellent - the bunk beds
are very solid and the facility is modern, and there is a large cupboard of
free food. It cost around €34 for a single bed in a four bed dormitory.</p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>For dinner I have just finished a pizza. It has been 8 days since my last
pizza in Bergen, and it;s nice to have a change from soup.</p>

<p>This evening I need to research my options for getting back to Berlin. This is
potentially, effectively, my last bicycle destination. My first plan is to get
the train to Oslo, and then the train to the south of Sweden in order to get
the ferry to Germany, where I will again get the train. But maybe there are
other options, and maybe I will need to do more cycling before I see Berlin
again.</p>

<p>The plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunday 15th rain to Oslo on Sunday, stay in hostel.</li>
<li>Monday 16-18th: Ride to Gothenburg</li>
<li>19th Train to Malmo (they leave regularly) and cycle to Trelleborg</li>
<li>20th Trelleborg ferry 18:00 arriving in Sassnitz (also leaving at 07:45)</li>
<li>21st Train from Sassnitz to Berlin. 2 regional trains.</li>
</ul>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It appears to be Friday the 13th. Today was a hard slog, most of the route was
hilly and there were no "natural" rests along the way - no ferries or tunnels
or places of note. I stopped for lunch at the top of a long climb.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-13/IMG_20180713_114911.jpg" alt="Valhalla" /></p>

<p><em>Valhalla</em></p>

<p>It was cold again last night and hard to get to sleep, I woke up multiple
times and ended up putting my trousers on in the sleeping bag and pulling my
arms inside of my t-shirt to achieve a level of comfort. I think next time I
will get a warmer sleeping bag.</p>

<p>I am now about 60km from potentially my last stop - Trondheim. I have already
booked the hostel, or at least I hope I have. I emailed them this morning,
they replied saying that they had beds available, and I replied saying that I
would take one, then left. I have no mobile internet, but later in the
afternoon I was in a supermarket and there was WiFi. I checked my emails and
they said that I should receive a booking confirmation. I didn't receive a
booking confirmation, so I emailed them back to confirm. However, as of now I
still have no internet, so there is a slight possibility that it is not
booked.</p>

<p>In the supermarket (arriving after my lunch) I got a pastry and two bread
rolls. The bread rolls were advertised as "2 for 20kr". That made me think, oh
hey, that's a good deal. Only after leaving the supermarket did I reflect that
I just paid about €2 for 2 bread rolls which would have cost at most 70 cents
in Germany. I neglected to get some other supplies - namely Onions and Lentils
for my soup tonight, so will have to make do with what I have left.</p>

<p>When I stopped for lunch, as previously mentioned, it was at the top of a long
climb. There was a picnic area (I was hoping there would be) and already two 
groups of people eating there, one group was leaving, and as I sat down on a
vacant table a motorcyclist talked to me.</p>

<p>He was from Heidelberg in Germany, and was impressed with my journey. He had
actually done my route on motorcycle, getting the ferry from Hirtshals and
riding up the coast to Trondheim, and he will now ride back down to Oslo. I
didn't ask how long it had taken him, but it's taken me two weeks. We spoke
mainly in German, and it was one of those cases where my German was only a bit
better than his English.</p>

<p>I passed another cycle tourer when riding down a hill, she was a young woman
riding alone - the second I've seen so far. Most of the cycle-tourers I've
seen or met have been cycling in pairs, I can only recall seeing two solo male
tourers on the road (excluding the tourer I met in the hostel in Bergen)</p>

<p><em>The Road</em></p>

<p>At the campsite I was lucky to have a power outlet by my tent, and Wifi
access. I was able to fully charge my power-pack and phone, and this morning I
downloaded some audio-books. "Sapiens" (a history of human kind) "The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich" (which was recommended) and Howards Zinn's "A Peoples
History of the United States".</p>

<p>I listened to over four hours of Zinn today. It's a book that is controversial
with the political right in America, as it presents history from the point of
view of the subjected - the native Americans, the indentured labourers, the
black slaves. And really presents the dark side of American history.</p>

<p><em>Cracked Road</em></p>

<p>I was glad to get to the campsite, the last part of the journey raised me to
an altitude of almost 500m - the highest so far that I'm aware of. The
cycle-tourer in Bergen gave me the impression that some passes were 1000s of
meters, but he may have been referring to the mountains rather than the
passes. None of the climbs have compared to the big climbs in the Pyrenees or
the Alps.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I woke with a stomach ache and there was lots of groaning as I
packed up my damp tent and filled my water bottles and tenderly made my way
back to the road.</p>

<p>The sky was and is overcast and has been so all day, but it hasn't been
raining.</p>

<p>The cycle route went indirectly around the coast, but there was another road
cutting straight across the land which saved around 15k. I wanted to make it
as far as possible today. There is a stretch to Trondheim of around 70k
without any campsites, so I wanted to get to the last one before that.</p>

<p>The road took me on to Norway's <a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/northwest/listings-northwest/national-tourist-route-atlanterhavsvegen/11862/">Engineering feat of the
century</a> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean_Road">Atlantic Ocean Road</a>. It took 6 years to build and was partially financed by tolls until 1999 when
the tolls were removed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_115229.jpg" alt="View from atlantic road" /></p>

<p><em>View from the Atlantic Road</em></p>

<p>This was the first time I really smelt the salty sea air as I rode over the
scattered mini-islands and bridges. There was lots of tourist traffic, and
camper vans, and people walking about on purpose-made bridges, clambering on
the rocks and looking at the sea.</p>

<p>I stopped for a coffee, my first coffee in Norway, it cost only 20kr (~€2) and
was filter coffee served in a paper cup. It tasted good though and made me
feel better.</p>

<p>After this I was riding to the end of the cycle path - or rather to the
Kristiansund tunnel through which I was required either to take a taxi or get
the bus.</p>

<p>As I rode up there was a cycle-route sign which provided me with this
information, it didn't say how often the buses ran though, it only gave me a
website, which I couldn't check, because <em>I have no mobile data</em>. Fortunately
there was a timetable across the way, unfortunately it had been battered by
the elements and was mostly illegible, but I could make out the possibility
that the bus ran maybe every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I waited, and very soon a bus appeared and pulled in. The driver got out and
put my baggage in the hold and I put my bike on the bus (there was a
wheelchair space). The bus could have carried 60 people, but there was only
one other passenger on this ride. It cost around €7. The tunnel went
underground and covered around 8km, when we exited the tunnel the driver
continued to the bus station in Kristiansund where I got out.</p>

<p>I had previously this day gone into an Intersport shop to try and find some
Camping Gaz, they didn't have any, but they suggested I try in Kristiansund,
so this was my first priority.</p>

<p>I first tried a hardware store, and they referred me to a maritime store. I
asked in English if they had any Camping Gaz, and they did. I paid (€14) and
said "Mange tak" (many thanks), and in return I got a "Har det bra" (goodbye):
my first successful Norwegian language transaction! Later in the day I also
managed to understand the amount I had to pay at a supermarket without
reverting to English.</p>

<p>I didn't stay long in Kirstiansund, I made my exit, riding through a section
of the harbour which seemed like a working ship-building museum.</p>

<p><em>View of Kristiansund from a bridge</em></p>

<p>I had now done about 75k, it was 15:00 and I hadn't eaten anything, and didn't
feel particularly tired or hungry and I was soon on the Tømmervåg ferry (cost
€4). On the ferry I made myself a sandwich while the other passengers helped
them selves expensive self-service food. 25 minutes later I rolled off the
ferry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_174734.jpg" alt="Another view from a bridge" /></p>

<p><em>View from a bridge, not on Kristiansund</em></p>

<p>This was the last ferry before Trondheim, and very probably the last ferry in
Norway on this trip. I'm not very sad - the ferries are a pain, and while most
of them have been running regularly, I have had issues with some that required
me to wait for so many hours, and of course they cost money.</p>

<p>On the final stretch it was very quiet - other than the periodic batch of
traffic from the ferry. A racing cyclist pulled up next to me, he was an older
man (probably retired) and we had a chat for around 10 to 15 minutes, the
normal stuff, where I'm from, where I'm going, where I'm <em>eventually</em> going,
etc. He recommended the campsite that I'm staying at now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-12/IMG_20180712_180904.jpg" alt="Clouds" /></p>

<p><em>Clouds</em></p>

<p>This campsite showed up on my map as "INTERNET-ACCESS: FEE CHARGED". Which
doesn't make it sound overalls appealing, but there was no other option (there
was another campsite, but it was on an island which required another ferry
trip).</p>

<p>The Wifi is however, is very free indeed (no password required). They also
have a kitchen (and the cooker doesn't cost anything). Today I bought some
dried peas, and I'm trying to cook a mainly pea soup, the peas have been
cooking for an hour now, and still not mushy, don't think they are the right
kind (think I should have gotten split-peas), but hopefully they will be soft
enough to be edible.</p>

<p>My final destination, Trondheim, is still around 170km away, which is
certainly doable in a day, but it wouldn't be a pleasant day at all. So I will
stay at another campsite tomorrow, and hopefully book a hostel in Trondheim,
or buy a train ticket and get the night train directly.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now sitting on the step of the sanitary block of a campsite by a Fjord
surrounded by high-rise mountains. The campsite cost 170kr (almost €18) for
the night, but the shower and cooker both cost 10kr each. I paid for the
shower, but used more of my increasingly precious camping gas to cook dinner.
The Wifi is at least free and so far I haven't encountered a campsite that
requires you to pay to use the toilet.</p>

<p>Last night was quiet and I woke early in the busy campsite, but remembered
that I needed to pay, so made to have my stuff packed up and ready at 8am -
but when I got to reception they didn't open until 9am. So I sat about doing
some work on my laptop and using the weak Wifi signal.</p>

<p>The plan was to head to Kristiansund today, but I quickly realised that it
wasn't achievable, it was at least 200km. But there were some target campsites
within a reasonable distance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/norway/2018-07-11/IMG_20180711_153644.jpg" alt="Reflection" /></p>

<p><em>Reflection</em></p>

<p>The weather was hot again, and my left hand still hasn't recovered from its
last bout of sunburn, so I wore my gloves all day. I only have a small amount
of sun cream, and am reluctant to buy more. I notice that today my nose is
also burnt.</p>

<p>I did another Norweigan lesson, lesson 19. I'm following it quite well, but
all my attempts at speaking Norwegian have ended in blank stares. I ask
"Vorstor du Engelsk?" <em>blank stare</em>, wait a beat, then "Do you speak English?"
and the answer is usually yes. Although I have encountered many more people
that don't speak English, especially ferry fare collectors.</p>

<p>I caught two ferries today, the first required me to wait for an hour and a
half. I had just passed a village park (which seemed to be the grounds of a
modern church) so I went back and sat down and had lunch and then dozed in the
sun for 45 minutes. Both ferries cost around €4.</p>

<p><em>First water fountain seen in Norway</em></p>

<p>I passed three sets of cycle tourers. One pair on a tandem and another who
looked very professional. They had fast bikes and no front or rear panniers.
The tent and other accessories were strapped lengthways at the back and at the
front for aerodynamics and the bikes were fast cycle-cross bikes. I passed and
waved, but didn't stop. They then overtook me at considerable speed. I
wondered if they had electric bikes - but it's just possible they were
actually cycling at that speed.</p>

<p>There was even more spectacular views today, especially when I took the ferry.</p>

<p>In the evenings I am writing these blog posts, eating and reading. When I
started as was reading "The Book Thief" and then started re-reading "The
Brothers Karamazov", the first time I read the Pevear-Volokhonsky translation,
this time it's the Victorian Constance Garrett version. I think I prefer the
Pevear version, but it has been many years. I started "Memoirs of a Geisha"
last night.</p>

<p><em>Three Hills</em></p>

<p>I will pass through Kristiansund tomorrow - it is on an island which has only
tunnel access, but it is not possible to cycle through it, so I imagine I will
need to get the bus. After that I will do one more nights camping and then
get to Trondheim, where I plan to stay in a hostel and then get the train to
Oslo and start making my way back to Germany.</p>

<p>The mosquitos and other bugs are becoming annoying while cycling towards the
end of the day, especially when cycling downhill. I have to either squint my
eyes to avoid "mosquito-eye" or angle the visor of my cap down so I can only
see the road immediately in front of me.</p>
