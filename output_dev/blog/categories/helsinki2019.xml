            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm sitting in the Eurphoria hostel in Tallinn, I got in around an hour and a
half ago, and have briefly explored the tourist saturated center, then came
back here and played guitar and piano for about an hour and a guy just came in
and sat at the drums. There is all the tools required for a band in this room,
which is one of the reasons I was attracted to this hostel, and I may be
staying here for a week.</p>

<p>I slept well last night and before sleeping watched the final two episodes of
Game of Thrones, and the <em>ending</em> wasn't as bad as I feared. This morning I
woke up hungry, which accorded with the number of kilometers I made yesterday,
I went out to the shop, but it was 8:30 and not open until 10, so I used the
hostel kitchen to make a breakfast with what I had: porridge, jam, partially
melted cheese slices and coffee.</p>

<p>It was now only 70k to Tallinn on the main road, and I guessed 100k by taking
some of the diversions through the Lahemaa National Park. I would now
certainly be staying in Tallinn this night, and so I researched hostels on
<code>hostelworld.com</code> and chose the Euphoria hostel (there were a number of nice
looking hostels, but the fact that Euphoria had a piano and a guitar swung it
for me), I phoned ahead and made sure they could store my bike, and booked
(online, as they weren't keen on booking me over the phone).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/1.JPG" alt="Recommended" /></p>

<p><em>The much recommended Project Kodu, which I passed, but I could have cycled
an extra 21k yesterday and stayed here if I had known</em></p>

<p>I left the hostel, dropping the keys at the post office next door - as
instructed - and when I handed the keys to the man behind the counter he
looked very confused, and pointed to the hostel next door, I insisted that I
had been asked to leave the keys here, and he went inside and fetched a lady -
possibly the very same who I met the previous evening - who understood and
took the keys - I honestly can't remember if it was the same lady or not.</p>

<p>I then rode out of Vosu and continued my journey through the national park.
Despite the road looking like it was following the coast, there were very few
occasions where I could actually see the sea, and the majority of the route
was the same -- trees lining each side of the road. But it was very quiet,
especially after I had a mantrum at my phone's audio player and decided it
wasn't worth the effort and unplugged it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/2.JPG" alt="Smoke on the water" /></p>

<p><em>Smoke on the water</em></p>

<p>I had given up on my MP3 player, and thought I'd try playing music from my
phone, but the phone's audio player was incredibly, to my eyes, badly
designed. All it has to do, according to me, is play files, organised by
folders, sorted by filenames - but no. It does no such thing, it probably does
just about everything else, but not that. So I lost my temper and was cursing
my phone for being so shitting stupid, and when I finally listened to music I
was in no mood, so I unplugged it and the rest of my day was silent.</p>

<p>When I did finally pass some coast I looked out across the Baltic sea to
Finland (I was mistaken) , and could see a column of cloud rising on the
horizon, it first occurred to me that it was smoke and something was on fire,
but then it was the wrong colour for smoke, so I guessed it was steam, and my
guess was confirmed later - I was looking at some kind of power plant outside
of Tallinn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/3.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Road</em></p>

<p>It was hot today, and as I started to feel thirsty, and then hungry (more so
for the longer day yesterday), I wanted an energy drink, in previous tours it
was beer, this time it's energy drinks, I need something at least slightly
malevolent for lunch, and I couldn't find a shop, eventually I realised that I
had a can of baked beans at least, and that would be more than enough for
lunch - all I needed now was a bench.</p>

<p>As it happened the next bench was 15km away - which is always the case - and
there was also a shop, so I got both an energy drink, some bread and 4
individually wrapped chocolates. I sat down on a bench outside of the close-by
post office and ate the beans, the bread, the chocolates and a pint of energy
drink, and then read a chapter of the book, and I was quite full.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/4.JPG" alt="Source of the smoke" /></p>

<p><em>Source of the smoke</em></p>

<p>Coming into Tallinn, there was the EuroVelo route, but it seemed unnecessarily
complex, and I tried to follow the main road, which was at this point dual
carriageway, but there were smaller roads either side with cycle paths, but
these were awful to cycle on, continuing only for half a kilometer before
turning one way or another and no clear indication of where they were going,
making me frustrated - I just wanted to follow a road for 4km - so in the end
I joined the now 3-lane dual carriage way, there were no signs prohibiting
cyclists, so I guess this was fine, if not comfortable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/5.JPG" alt="TV tower" /></p>

<p><em>TV tower, similar to the one in Berlin</em></p>

<p>The hostel I arrived at easily enough and checked in, there were already
people playing music.</p>

<p>I have just played for about another hour, and now when writing this blog some
guy has pulled out his saxophone accompanied by picked chords on an electric
guitar, it's jazz and it sounds as amazing as a saxophone does cutting into
the empty air.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/6.JPG" alt="View on Tallinn" /></p>

<p><em>View on the old town close to the hostel</em></p>

<p>This is potentially my last post, this was my original destination. I just
found out that the ferry to Helsinki is not as expensive as I thought (maybe
only €20) but the ferry to Trevemunde will be much more expensive, so I will
likely get the bus, but will see what happens in the next week - which is a
long time.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had prepared for a long day today, and after two days at the Looming hostel
in Tartu I was feeling fresh and ready to go in this morning. I had had some
good chats with people at the hostel, and the experience was running through
my mind for the first few hours of the trip this morning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/1.JPG" alt="Tortu" /></p>

<p><em>Tortu's main square this morning</em></p>

<p>The weather was fine as I left the hostel and headed down to the river, and I
felt good. I had planned to do 150k today, the town of Rakvere was the
logical stop at around the 100k mark, but there were no hotels under €50 and
no campsites, so I had decided to continue to the coast and hope that the
campsite on my map was existing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/2.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake with church behind trees</em></p>

<p>There was a meandering EuroVelo cycle route from Tartu to Talinn, this route
heads up to the coast before heading east to Tallinn. I decided instead to
stick to the main road however, approximating the main points of route and
throughout the day I was either crossing the cycle route, or breifly joining
it before regaining the main road, there were some exceptions where the cycle
route was more direct, or equidistant to the main road, but the most part I
stuck to the main road.</p>

<p>Cycling today was surprisingly easy, and I managed to keep an average speed of
just over 20kmph for the whole day, I listened to the random songs on my MP3
player for about 6-7 hours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/3.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>75% of today was like this</em></p>

<p>I stopped after 50km (energy drink and cake), and then at 100km (at Väike
Maarga) for lunch (another energy drink, a cheese/peanut-butter/nuts sandwich,
and half a bar of chocolate. On both stops I read a chapter from Jane Eyre.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/4.JPG" alt="Square outside the town hallin Rackvere" /></p>

<p><em>Square outside the town hall in Väike Maarja</em></p>

<p>I cycled around Rakvere at around 120k, passing a cemetery for German
soldiers, which was part of a <a href="https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/3638/German-War-Cemetery-Wesenberg---Rakvere.htm">German military
hospital</a>
during World War II.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/5.JPG" alt="Cemetary" /></p>

<p><em>Cemetary for German Soldiers</em></p>

<p>At one point I cycled past a couple and a man held out his arm at me, but I
didn't understand the gesture, he was not waving or putting is thumb up, and
didn't seem to be smiling, but he was looking directly at me. I slowed down
and he said something to me in Estonian, which at least didn't sound
particularly threatening, I said "I don't understand..." at which point he
turned around and I carried on and wondered for the next quarter of an hour if
he meant to impart some important knowledge to me, but nothing significant
happened on the subsequent road except around 10km of road works, which in ,
this case, weren't very disruptive. There were no traffic lights, only
yellow-jacketed men waving cars past, and who would wave me past
unconditionally. Most of the road was open despite the resurfacing.</p>

<p>About 20km from the campsite I noticed that I had a choice between 3
campsites, one was the original one I had aimed for, which was north east, the
other two were north-west. By taking the north-west option I would perhaps
miss some of the coast, but having two campsites on the map meant that my
accommodation options would be more secure for tonight, so I chose the
north-west ones. These were actually slightly further away, and I was also
glad that this would make my day at least 163km - a number which is
significant to me because it is 100 miles, and would be the first "century" I
have done in some years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/6.JPG" alt="Main street in Rakvere" /></p>

<p><em>Main street in Rakvere</em></p>

<p>I was, I noticed, riding through the Lahemaa National Park, which had been
recommended to me on a few times, once by a girl in Riga, and the other time
just last night by two or three separate people. I wasn't particularly
interested in being here however, I think it's more popular for hiking and
such things, I would like to see the coast, but as it turns out you can't see
it from the road at all.</p>

<p>The first campsite I arrived at was a free campsite. There was nobody there,
but it was clearly indicated that you could camp, and light a fire. There was
firewood, dry or chemical toilets and a sheltered, long, table. It seemed
lonely and a four wheel drive stopped at the entrance while I cycled into
investigate and I had the (surely wrong) impression that I was being watched.
I decided to check out the other campsite first, although this one seemed
ideally ideal, it didn't have Wifi - at least that was my excuse.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/7.JPG" alt="First campsite" /></p>

<p><em>Open campsite</em></p>

<p>The next campsite on my map didn't exist at all, there was no trace of it in
the village where it was situated, I could go back to the free campsite or
carry on another 13km to the next settlement which had a number of campsites
and a hostel.</p>

<p>I was now clearly breaking into my all time top 10 touring rides for distance,
but the time wasn't very extreme (by contrast I think I've had rides some 
years previous of 13 hours achieving 160km or less).</p>

<p>When I entered the town I perked up at the idea of staying in a hostel,
presumably full with hikers and outdoor people, and as it's in a village there
would surely be an opportunity to get a pizza and some beer.</p>

<p>I almost didn't stay at the hostel, it was only by chance that when I wheeled
up and opened the door the owner was in the kitchen to meet a repairman - I
think if she were not there I would not have gone to the effort of phoning -
it wasn't a "hostel" hostel, it was more of a guest-house with communal
facilities.</p>

<p>When she told me the price was €30 part of me said "No!" and the other part
felt committed already and was looking forward to the pizza. I said I'd think
about it and went outside and studied my map for a minute, if only to see the
campsite just 1km down the road which I knew was there, and I decided to stay.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/9.JPG" alt="Beach" /></p>

<p><em>Beach at Vosu</em></p>

<p>"What time will you leave?" "err, 8 or 9" "If you leave at 9, then leave the
key in the post office next door" She didn't give me an option for leaving
before 9.</p>

<p>I felt bad until she showed me the room, it is a spacious minimal room with a
terrace with two beds, so now all I needed was that pizza. So I left, the
first restaurant had none, only a "vegetarian option" of fries and some
vegetables. The next was only slightly better by offering pasta and feta
cheese, for €5. I ordered a beer too, and was surprised that that put the
price at €9! The pasta was none that good also, and the croutons which were
spread over the top were stale.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/10.JPG" alt="Hostel" /></p>

<p><em>The hostel</em></p>

<p>Still, the supermarket is open (I hope), and there is (I hope) Wifi at the
hostel, and I should be able to retire with a few beers and maybe I can finish
watching Game of Thrones and see how everybody lives happily ever after.</p>

<p>Tomorrow should be my last bike ride (or at least I can easily cover the
remaining distance to Tallinn in one day). I should have about 1 week in
Tallinn unless I decide to return to Berlin early.</p>

            <id>/blog/2019/07/21/tartu-rest-days/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I intended to stay two nights in Tartu, but have ended up staying three. There
seem to be no logical resting places for tomorrows journey within a 120km
distance (other than hotels which I would consider to be beyond what I'd be
happy to pay), and the next campsite is on the coast, which would be 155km - a
long day. The following day I could do an even longer day and make it all the
way to Talinn, which is either 100km direct, or, if following the coast (and I
really should follow the coast) it's almost 163km, 100 miles and this last
act of masochism seems fitting for the last journey on this trip, although
there is also an outdoor "hostel" or "retreat" in the forest outside of
Tallinn which has been recommended to me twice, so that may break my journey.</p>

<p>In Tartu I got drunk the first night with a guy who was here for Metallica
concert (to be fair it was mainly me doing the drinking, he was waiting to get
the bus back at 2am), the next day I went for a run.</p>

<p>Tartu is situated on a river and has a few parks on it's south bank, and I was
able to run through these parks and then back along the river bank, over the
bridge in the center of town and then along the other side to another bridge.
The weather has been very fine, and there were very few people to be found
outside of the town (just a couple of people fishing, and the occasional
jogger).</p>

<p>Inside the town on my first day it was uncomfortably packed, as there was some
kind of "Medieval" festival happening, but when I found myself in the throng
of the crowd, my instinct was to remove myself as quickly as possibly, the
only medieval thing I saw was a single lost-looking woman in a medieval
(or Tudor) costume. But I'm told by some of the hostel guests that it really
was a lot of fun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-21/1.png" alt="Cathedral" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined cathedral in Tartu (from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<p>Other than this I have been making solid efforts on my programming project,
which is rather starting to annoy me now, and I'm wonder at the amount of time
I have spent on this thing (it has been in the works since March). I hope it's
finished to a useful state soon and provides some redeeming value.</p>

<p>Last night I researched books to read, I'm currently reading "The Castle", an
unfinished novel by Franz Kafka, but after 150 pages, not really enjoying it.
I found a list of 100 books to read before you die, the top one was "To kill a
mockingbird", which I already read, the second was "Pride and Prejudice",
which I hadn't (and somehow it doesn't appeal to me), and somewhere on the
list I found "Jane Eyre", which I happened to have on my ebook device, so I'm
starting with that now.</p>

<p>I am now sitting in the hostel after having eaten my breakfast and am about to
leave, the weather has been excellent for the past two days, but today it
looks to rain and I can fill the cool air blowing through the open window to
my back.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As predicted I slept terribly, falling initially to sleep but soon waking up
as my head wasn't comfortable (it was supported inappropriately on my hoody which
was in turn supported by my food pannier). As usual when I realised that it
was morning and I could get <em>out</em> of bed, falling to sleep was no longer an
issue and I didn't wake until 9am. So I slept badly <em>and</em> got out of bed late.</p>

<p>I washed the remnants of last week's breakfast from the pots and pans and
cooked porridge, and ate the rest of the cheese slices.</p>

<p>The previous night I found and phoned ahead to the "Looming" hostel in Tartu,
and this morning I was surprised to find it already bookmarked on my map -- I
think somebody must have recommended it to me in another hostel, although I
don't remember it.</p>

<p>It attracted me as it was a so-called "art" hostel, and looked good, although
on <code>hostelworld.com</code> the beds for both 6 and 12 room dorms were advertised at
€30. I thought this must have been a mistake, and when I checked the website
they were advertised at €17/€18. So I phoned and got those prices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/1.JPG" alt="Quiet" /></p>

<p><em>Quiet road with cycle path, group of school children running on cycle path in
far distance</em></p>

<p>There was a cycle route all the way to Tartu, with distances regularly marked,
but there seemed to be a discrepancy, as I estimated 80k to the city, but the
cycle path said 108k. On checking it made a significant detour, which I was
able to avoid, infact I ended up doing the last 10k on the main road.</p>

<p>In general the cycle paths were very good, and even the gravel sections were
fine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/2.JPG" alt="Drive-by" /></p>

<p><em>Riding past a lake</em></p>

<p>After 40k I stopped for lunch, and found some "real" bread in the supermarket,
albeit bread with raisins in it, but it was freshly baked and tasted good.</p>

<p>At one section a primary school class and accompanying adults seemed to be
running down the cycle path, and three older boys (who presumably started
before the 5 year olds) were overtaking them running at a good pace and I
wondered if running is a part of physical education here, or just a special
event. There were also more than a few people with cruising on the paths with
"dry skis" (skis with roller-blades), something I never saw in
Latvia/Lithuania.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/4.JPG" alt="Panorama of field" /></p>

<p><em>finds panorama mode on camera</em></p>

<p>The MP3 player backlight has now completely gone, but I was somehow able to
put it into random mode, and listened to a good random selection of songs for
the few hours prior to arriving in Tartu by the aforementioned, busy, main
road - although I did manage to turn off before hitting the center by crossing
a railway track.</p>

<p>The hostel seems good, if a little expensive (although I think it's average
here in Estonia). There is no free breakfast, or free coffee, but they do have
a strong ideology, everything (decoration, furniture) in the hostel is made
from recycled/second-hand materials, and they are keen on you minimising waste
and the hostel's ecological footprint etc. They have a large terrace (which is
worryingly next to the dorm, but they have a 11:00 quiet rule) and the bunk
beds are sturdy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/5.JPG" alt="Rebase" /></p>

<p><em>Always advocating git rebase</em></p>

<p>One guy in my room was at the Metallica concert - the old man at the campsite
yesterday evening had mentioned that there was a concert in Tartu, and that
consequently all the chalets and beds were booked out (the campsite was 80km
away from the concert).</p>

<p>I did some work for a few hours, and then went in search of a pizza and beer.
I found a Pizza place and sat down, ordered a beer, but the waiting time for
Pizza was 60 minutes, so I opted to order pasta instead, which is a shame as
the pizzas here look really good, and the pasta I could have happily made that
myself and it would have tasted the same.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-19/6.JPG" alt="Freight train" /></p>

<p><em>Freight train</em></p>

<p>I think I'll stay here for another night, it seems to be around 300km to
Tallinn, which would presumably be my next "rest" stop and I have around 10
days left.</p>

<p>The title of this blog is "Berlin to Helsinki" but originally it was to
"Tallinn", the only reason it was to Helsinki was because I intended to get
the ferry back, but the ferry will cost at least €250, not including the €50
crossing to Helsinki, and the €100 for trains from Kiel to Berlin. The
alternatives are bus (27 hours) or plane, both of which will require me to
pack my bike, but after getting some bike-packing tips from Stefan (wrap it in
clingfilm and cardboard for the sharp bits) I think this shouldn't be too much
of a problem.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the hotel I settled down with a few beers and Series 8 of of Game of
Thrones, I hadn't watched it up until this point despite being, like most
other people, a big fan of the earlier seasons, but it had got progressively
worse and I predicted this, the final, series would be mediocre, it wasn't
great, but none-the-less still intriguing enough that I watched 4 episodes
back to back.</p>

<p>I woke up relatively late and had the included buffet breakfast, accidentally
picking up a splodge of what I assumed to be a vegetarian-friendly, mayonaised
salad, but then realising with some regret that I was eating some kind of
meat. The rest of the breakfast was standard cheese, cucumber, cereal, coffee
etc.</p>

<p>I picked up my bike which was locked in the shed, the chain and gears had
suffered with the rain and sand, with rust showing on the, now dry,
de-lubricated chain. I washed it down with some water and sprayed lubricant on
it then left, heading directly to Valka/Valga, the twin towns on the border of
Latvia and Estonia, which was around 80-90km north-east. I left at around
10am.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/1.JPG" alt="Promise of rain" /></p>

<p><em>Promise of rain</em></p>

<p>Although the weather forecast (for Riga at least) predicted it would not rain,
it did rain for an hour or just after I took lunch at the town of Smiltene,
where I looked for a bakery. I haven't found a single bakery in all my time in
Latvia (although I did see a couple of pastry/cake shops), and none of the
supermarkets I've visited have fresh bread, only nasty pre-packaged bread.
This town was no exception, and in the supermarket I picked up only some
"vegetable paste" and some pre-sliced cheese. I sat down on a bench and pulled
out some of the packaged rye-bread I had purchased around 5 days ago and the
top slice had already signs of mould, but the next one seemed fine.</p>

<p>As the rain poured down I tried listening to music. About a week ago, when
camping, in the rain, I had left my MP3 player in the grass overnight, and it
had gotten soaked through, surprisingly it still works, but the backlight has
progressively gotten worse to the point now where it is nearly impossible to
see the screen, and the headphones I purchased, despite their initial quality,
have also degraded to the point where music sounds klangy and actually not very
musical at all. But for audiobooks it's fine, and I carried on with Zinn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/2.JPG" alt="Valka" /></p>

<p><em>Town sign</em></p>

<p>At Valka I crossed immediately to Valga, and passed the erstwhile border
checkpoint to Estonia. Stefan had said that he felt Estonia had more trees, as
Lithuania already had quite a few trees, I wondered what "more" trees would
look like, and indeed when riding out of Valga there were more trees. Very big
trees, I think the ones I passed today were all managed forests, and
occasionally sections were cleared, and other sections newly replanted, but
mostly just big trees on either side of the road. The weather had improved and
there was a mild wind, the sun, and the rustling of the wind blowing through
the big trees.</p>

<p>Stefan also mentioned that there were bears here in Estonia (and the other
Baltic countries). This has crossed my mind a few times, although I'm sure any
danger is virtually non-existant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/3.JPG" alt="Estonia" /></p>

<p><em>Estonia</em></p>

<p>The other thing I noticed when crossing the border was that the roads improved
significantly - not only was there asphalt on the yellow roads on my map, but
some of the lesser white ones too. Estonia I think has a better economy than
Latvia/Lithuania, and I expect things to be a little more expensive (actually
both Latvia and Lithuania <em>seemed</em> more expensive than Poland, especially
regarding hotels).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/5.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Section of cleared forest, some trees are usually left standing</em></p>

<p>I had originally considered staying in a hostel in Valga, there were two, but
didn't commit myself, the other option was a campsite/hostel about 14km
further, which is where I am staying now. I checked out the hostel in Valga,
but it didn't look appealing, it was a large concrete, featureless house with
a closed door, and I suspected it might rather be a cheap place for locals to
stay rather than a travellers hostel (it didn't show up on <code>hostelworld.com</code>)
so I moved on.</p>

<p>Not having any internet, the only thing I had which made me believe there was
an isolated campsite/hostel 14km away from Valga was the offline map on my
phone, which in no way guarantees a place is open, or even if it still exists,
but I was relieved when approaching to see official "Hostelling Estonia" signs
pointing to my destination on the rural country roads.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/4.JPG" alt="Estonia Hostelling" /></p>

<p><em>Hostelling sign - previous one had "Estonia Hostelling" written underneath</em></p>

<p>When I arrived the reception was closed but soon an old man appeared and
greeted me. He was very friendly and showed interest into where I was from,
and when I wrote down my address in the registrar he even knew the road I
lived on in Berlin, as he was frequently there when he was younger - it
occurred to me later that he would have been in his prime during the Russian
occupation. He was not the first to ask if I studied in Berlin, which is
always a bit surprising as I finished studying almost 14 years ago.</p>

<p>Drinking water is taken from a pump which pumps ground water from 70m below,
there is a place to make a fire with lots of wood, and the man sold me a
couple of beers and some bread.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/6.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Large trees on either side</em></p>

<p>I had the option to stay in a bunk bed, or camp. I chose to camp, I'm not sure
why. It's cheaper, and it has it's charm, and this is a perfect place to camp
(there is no noise other than the rustling trees). But I am almost certainly
not going to sleep well tonight, but that has the benefit of starting early
and probably arriving in Tartu at around mid-day, hopefully with a hostel
booked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-18/7.JPG" alt="Campsite" /></p>

<p><em>Campsite, flag poles out of shot on the left have Estonian, EU and German
flags flying</em></p>

<p>Seeds are falling from the trees today, and as I'm typing this and looking
ahead of me I can see hundreds of little seed-particles blowing around, there
are several on my laptop keyboard.</p>

<p>Today was a good day for cycling, despite the rain earlier, the weather has
been perfect.</p>

            <id>/blog/2019/07/17/riga-cesis/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Typing this in a Pizzeria as usual, but unfortunately my laptop's power was
drained s I'm typing this awkwardly on my phone. I am in Cēsis, an historical
town 100km north-east of Riga.</p>

<p>At the hostel I woke relatively late, 9:00, and was able to take advantage of
the free waffles for breakfast, washing them down with a good deal of free
coffee.</p>

<p>After two days rest my arse was road worthy again. I was glad to leave the
hostel, having not really been succeeded in being effectively social and felt
detatched (for no good reason), but I was also reluctant hit the road again,
lacking mental energy.</p>

<p>I did however openly discuss my trajectory during my stay and heading
northeast towards Tartu in Estonia looks like a good target, it has about 4
hostels and apparently is a student town - and would take me through this
town, Cēsis which is famous for it's castle (again related to the once
omni-present Tutonic knights).</p>

<p>There was a cycle path accompanying the main road out of Riga which alternated
sides of the 4 labe,busy, road. This ended after a period however and I
switched to forest and country roads, before the main road split a.d the
traffic was much reduced. I flowed this until the town of Sigulda.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/1.JPG" alt="Road out of Riga" /></p>

<p><em>Road out of Riga</em></p>

<p>Here it started spitting raina and the sky had the now familiar even leaden
pregnant look which gave this spitting rain the significance of predicting a
heavy downpour. Cēais was off the main route and I headed north east out of
the town and the asphalt gave way to the beloved gravel, soon after tgethunder
started rolling and it rained hard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/2.JPG" alt="Back to sand" /></p>

<p><em>More sand</em></p>

<p>I also discovered that I was riding on the "tour de LatEst" cycle route, which
is marked on my map and which goes at least to this town, and probably all the
way to Tartu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/5.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>LatEst</em></p>

<p>The gravel-sand is more problematic in the rain, and the sand grains are
attracted to my gears causing them to crunch, grind and vacillate (??).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/4.JPG" alt="Caves" /></p>

<p><em>These caves entrances were scattered everywhere at Līgatne</em></p>

<p>I avoided energy drinks today and managed thus to avoid road directed
tantrums, instead again listening to the Howard Zinn book and largely ignoring
the road, rain and thunder. I seem to be missing around 10 chapters and was
fast forwarded to the Clinton administration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/6.JPG" alt="Bridge of Doom" /></p>

<p><em>There was a diversion which I missed, and this bridge was the cause of it -
luckily I could cross (even if I risked being impaled by the exposed iron
works)</em></p>

<p>I had stopped for a coffee in Sigulda outside the train station, I sat down and
they had free wifi. (no password - which seems much more common here than in
western europe in general), and I booked hotel in Cēsis, there were campsites,
but, well, I could book a relatively cheap hotel (€30) with breakfast and
get a good nights sleep (hopefully).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-17/3.JPG" alt="Sigulda" /></p>

<p><em>Sigulda</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow the weather hopes to be better, and I will ride to Valka/Valga - the
twin cities separated by the Latvian / Estonian border, where I will endevour
to stay in a hostel (there seems to be at least one), after that the next stop
is Tartu,</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't seem to have succeeded in integrating very well in the hostel I've
been staying in for the past 2 days, having not really broken the ice with
people in general (with some exceptions) and feeling a little depressed and
drained. Most of the staff and guests are relatively young (one girl, 18, is 
still at high school in Italy) so maybe it's the generation gap. I did have a
good chats with a guy from Wales, and another from Helsinki.</p>

<p>My activities have been running, programming and drinking (coffee by day, beer
by night). Being careful not to run to fast (due to recurring injury) I have
managed to do to ~8-10k runs, following the same route, through the beautiful
"victory park" (??) running along the stream, crossing the bridge over the
river ---- then running down to the next one and crossing back and running
through the old
town.</p>

<p>Like Vilnius, Riga has a huge number of churches and God doesn't seem to be
dead here, religious thought is given to the deceased in the countless
well-kept grave yards I have encountered on the route, whilst graveyards are
usually abandoned in the UK, here there it seems there is almost always some
people walking about, maintaining the graves and paying their respects, even
in otherwise remote areas.</p>

<p>Today I visited the "Museum of the Occupation", if you google this museum you
will see a large and impressive building, rectangular with black slate panels.
This building however is undergoing renovation, and the museum has been moved
to a building in a series of embassy-like buildings just outside of the old
town.</p>

<p>Admission to the museum was an optional donation, I donated €5 and walked
upstairs. The "museum" was really just three rooms, each with a numbered
series of panels. Each room presenting a different era of occupation starting
from the end of World War I when both Germany and Russia had to relinquish
their claims on the Baltic states leaving them to declare independence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-16/1.JPG" alt="Electric Arch" /></p>

<p><em>Some kind of "Electric Arch" with the Nativity Cathedral showing in the
background</em></p>

<p>This ended when Nazi Germany and the USSR agreed to partition Poland
between them and for the Baltic states to be incorporated into the USSR. They
immediately started deporting natives and importing Russians, deprecating the
currency and persecuting political "enemies".</p>

<p>In 1941 however Germany declared war on Russia and invaded and occupied the
rest of Poland and the Baltic states, and applying their Jewish policies. In
1944 the states were "liberated" by the Red Army, and then the situation
reverted to the original Russian occupation, and this continued for 50 years
until 1991 when Mikhail Gorbachev instigated economic reforms and the Baltic
states decided that now was the time to declare themselves independent, the
Russians attempted to regain control by force, but eventually an agreement was
made and the states become once again independent.</p>

<p>Around 800,000 Russians were bought in to the country during the occupation
(the Germans immigrated 180,000, but all were forcefully expelled at the end
of the war). Apparently in 1981 the percentage of Latvians in Riga was only
36.5%.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-16/2.png" alt="Freedom Monument" /></p>

<p><em>Freedom Monument (taken from Wikipedia): Errected in 1918 to celebrate
Latvian independence and surviving to present day</em></p>

<p>I guess I will move again tomorrow - I will go north east, to the national
park and the town of Cēsis where there is a castle and some hotels, from there
heading into Estonia, aiming maybe for the town of Tartu before going to
Tallinn.</p>

<p>I researched options for returning to Germany today -- the boat from Helsinki
will cost around €250, not including the €50 ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki.
Which is more expensive than I imagined. There is also a bus option -- which
would cost significantly less (and take 27 hours).</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The road suddenly changed from a very smooth asphalt road to the worst kind
of gravel road, and showed no sign of stopping. Potentially running for the
remaining 50k to Riga, cars would drive past kicking dirt into the air which
would sting my eyes and force me to angle my cap down to avert the dust, which
consequently meant my field of vision was restricted to what was immediately
in front of me.</p>

<p>The two energy drinks I had forced my temper to break at a couple of points I
was shouting angrily at the road. It was the third long day in a row and
sometimes I regretted making it so. I had the option this morning of riding
all the way to Riga on the primary road, a total distance of around 100km, but
I had assumed it would be too busy, and perhaps boring. My alternate route
would rejoin the (planned) EuroVelo route, but required trekking back 5km to
the turning, then heading 20km North, before "resuming" my journey west to
Riga. But finally I'm glad I did, it was almost certainly more interesting
than riding 100km primary route (even if it was Sunday and there was not much
traffic).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/6.JPG" alt="Dust" /></p>

<p><em>Dust - by the time I got the camera ready the worst was over</em></p>

<p>The slightly zany lady at the hotel prepared my breakfast, but I don't think
she understood me when I told her I was vegetarian the previous night, or she
had forgotten, as she brought out a plate with two large boiled sausages, with
gherkin, tomatoes and cheese, with bread, jam, honey, butter, and a yoghurt. I
did my best to eat everything but the sausages, but it was too much, and when
she brought out another 4 slices of cheese I tried to say no, but she assumed
I was being polite, and that I really did want the cheese.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/1.JPG" alt="Ruiner manor" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined Manor</em></p>

<p>Some other guests (possibly family) were having breakfast, and the lady used
them to translate to me "Daniel! (speaking in Latvian, or Russian) - "You can
stay in your room until 12" and so on, last night she was switching to another
level of conversation by asking if such-and-such was the right word in German
("Setzen sich" oder "Setzen!" "Setzen ist Richtig?" and she was even writing
down some phrases and used my phone to translate if I wanted herbs on my
dinner. He name, I found out eventually, was Kristi, and I said goodbye and
thank you as I cycled back up to take my alternate route to Riga.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/2.JPG" alt="Grass Hopper" /></p>

<p><em>Grass Hopper - these things make lots of noise</em></p>

<p>Today again I spent lots of time listening to Howard Zinn's book. Today was
about the organization of Labour movements from in the 19th century, the
Spanish-American war and subsequent American empire building in the
Philippines. Each chapter is around 2h, and there are at least 22 of them.</p>

<p>The route was particularly picturesque today, I passed through a few
isolated villages, and an industrial area that nature was reclaiming, and
often the road was very smooth and from a small altitude you could see a
landscape of boundless forest.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/3.JPG" alt="Flat landscape" /></p>

<p><em>Flat landscape</em></p>

<p>There was a headwind, as I was now cycling into the great wind which had
propelled me from Berlin, but it was not to severe, however at one point I did
question why I was struggling to maintain 20km on a flat (according to my
altimeter), even with the wind didn't seem strong enough to account for it, I
thought to check my rear brakes.</p>

<p>I picked up the rear of the bike by the seat and kicked the wheel to spin it
with my foot - as I suspected it moved but then stopped: the brake was in
contact with the wheel. I adjusted the brake to give it more power to pull
back from the wheel, and also lubricated it. My gears have been very stiff recently
also, and I also lubricated the place where the cables pass under the drive,
and that made them easier to change, and the bike seemed a <em>bit</em> faster now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/4.JPG" alt="Ruined factory" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined Factory</em></p>

<p>I had a couple of energy drinks today, one more than normal, and felt a bit
high, and then irritable, especially when my bike ran over the ruts in the bad
road vibrating everything violently and the cars drove past followed by plumes
of dust blinding me. One energy drink is fine, two is too much for me, like
beer.</p>

<p>The approach to Riga reminded me of the approach to Vilnius - just a big road
for 3-5km where I tried to stay on the pavement, the hostel was easy to find,
which is just as well, as my phone's internet ran out of internet without
warning today.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-14/5.JPG" alt="Lookout" /></p>

<p><em>Lookout Tower</em></p>

<p>This was annoying -- I had received no text at all when I crossed any border,
and no text when I had used, f.e. 80% of my allowance, and only a text when it
was <em>all gone</em> and with no apparent suggestion on how I can get more. Fucking
useless.</p>

<p>I was approaching the hostel but could only see a McDonald's, on closed
inspection the McDonald's also had about 10 placards on either side of the
door, about 5 of these were hostels, and one of them mine. I expect they are
all owned by the same person. I wheeled my bike awkwardly through McDonald's,
through a door on the opposite side, my hostel was on the 3rd floor, so I
de-mobilised my bike and took my phone and laptop bag and ran up 3 flights of
stairs, rang the buzzer, was invited in but then I said "I have a bike", "Oh,
well, we don't have much room, but I think we can.." "OK, then, I go get it!"
and I ran down the stairs and then back up with my mostly laden bike and a
few unnecessary grunts as I struggled carrying the heavy thing up all the
stairs.</p>

<p>There were around 6 people sitting in the central common area, the beds look
very good and solid, there are "pancakes" for breakfast, beer is taken on a
trust system, where you tally your beers with a pen (but then each costs a
whole €2, and there is an off license downstairs selling beers for €1), and
tonight there is a free vegetarian lasagna - it's being served in 5
minutes, but I'm not in the hostel, I went for a walk to find a pizza and a
beer in order to write this blog post.</p>

<p>So far Riga is not the cheapest place, the Pizza I just had is probably one
the cheaper places, and it cost €8, and the beer €3.50 - more or as expensive
as Berlin, but I guess this is the tourist area.</p>

<p>It is now only 3 days by primary road to Tallinn - the planned end of the
tour, and I am now 2 weeks in and have 2 weeks left - so I might stay in
either or both Riga and Tallinn for longer periods (and also perhaps take a
more scenic route to Tallinn, but this could only add a day or two).</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As normal I slept not to well on the campsite, but woke up at 06:00 and made
breakfast (coffee, porridge, and some pastry things I found in a shop) and was
out on the road at around 08:00 heading to the Latvian border.</p>

<p>It looked to be another sunny day, yesterday I had worn my vest for the first
time since being burnt over a week ago, and was annoyed that I had burnt again
in the same place, I sprayed some sun lotion on to my back and put on my shirt
instead of the vest.</p>

<p>I headed north-north-east passing lots of lakes including the town of Dusetos,
making my way 50km to the Latvian border where I crossed to the Latvian town
of Subate. It was now 11:30, and I pulled off the main road and cycled to the
center of the village, found the (super)market and purchased a beer and some
peanuts, before sitting down on a bench in the nice green square and making
lunch (hard cheese blocks in dark bread pasted with peanuts peanut butter to
hold the peanuts in place). I also got some chocolates which was dangerous as
all 6 were quickly dispatched and I decided buying chocolates is always a bad
idea.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/2.JPG" alt="Latvia" /></p>

<p><em>Latvia</em></p>

<p>I idly looked up the Wikipedia for what now seems to be a village, it used to
be a larger settlement of around 2,300 people in 1914, now it has only 940,
it's entire Jewish population was murdered during WW II.</p>

<p>I had an option in around 10km of either turning west and finding a place to
stay in the 2nd biggest city in Latvia, Daugavpils, which would have made
around 100km, but I decided against it when I couldn't see any affordable
accommodation, and decided instead to head towards Riga and build up some more
spare days.</p>

<p>After passing the point of no return I listed to an audiobook, I thought I had
"Bill Brysons Short History of almost Everything", but instead I had Howard
Zinn's "A Peoples History of the United States" and I spent 4 hours listening
to 4 chapters: How women were oppressed, How the Indian lands were taken, The
Mexican War (invading Mexico), and a chapter about the abolition of Slavery and
the civil war, but to be honest my concentration was waning at this point. But
it passed a great deal of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/1.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lots of lakes around these parts</em></p>

<p>It wasn't at all clear where I would rest tonight, Jekabpils was the logical
place a largish city, at around 130km, but there didn't seem to be any
accommodation or camping there. If I couldn't find any accommodation there then
there was a town 15km further on which ostensibly offered a campsite and some
motels.</p>

<p>The road today was extremely flat after some initial hills, passing into
Latvia I noticed a number of what I guess are nuclear bomb shelters in
peoples gardens.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/3.JPG" alt="Bomb shelter" /></p>

<p><em>One of three back-garden bomb shelters I saw today</em></p>

<p>The road was mainly surrounded by forests, at one point this changed to a
massive clearing of freshly dug earth, it looked as if an enormous amount of
forest had been cleared and the earth turned over.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/4.JPG" alt="Missing trees" /></p>

<p><em>Missing trees</em></p>

<p>I passed through Jekabpils without seeing any accommodation (I did see a
Motel on the way out, but it was on the wrong side of the road, and anyway it
was raining and somehow I had already decide to ride to the next town). It
started raining and I hit a main road to Riga.</p>

<p>There was no other option that to take the two lane road with it's traffic and
lorries. Unfortunately there are no asphalt hard-shoulders in either Latvia or
Lithuania  (possibly also Poland) only gravel which is not fun to cycle on,
and possibly even dangerous if attempting to pass over it at speed. This is
where my mirror comes in handy, and with constant attention I can ride on to
the hard shoulder when big lorries burn past without risking a close shave.</p>

<p>Around this time my phone battery died, but the way seemed clear enough in my
memory and I crossed a bridge and turned left, following the lake that the
town of Plavinas lives on, and started looking for the hotel. Without my
phone's GPS I wasn't sure exactly where I was going, and I asked a local, who
happened to be a kid of around 14, and he spoke English and was able to
respond to my question negatively when I asked him if there was a Hotel in
either direction.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-13/5.JPG" alt="Approaching rain" /></p>

<p><em>Approaching rain</em></p>

<p>I carried on down the road, and went to the effort of connecting my phone to a
battery and found the Motel I had seen on it in the morning, I headed to it,
but couldn't see any motel, then looking around more closely there was a dirty
house with "Motels" written on it, but it didn't look like anybody was home
and I might find a better place later so I continued, there was another Motel
and then the campsite.</p>

<p>The next Motel also looked empty, there were no cars out front, and I could
see no movement or lights (although it was day). I pulled up, there was a bar
building on the left, and the "Motel" on the right. I tried the door to the
motel, it was open, and I went upstairs, and said "Hello?" but there were only
rooms. When I came back down there was a lady that had appeared from the bar
"Do you speak English?" she shook her head and beckoned me to follow.</p>

<p>The lady knew a few words of German, and assumed that I was German, and was
surprised that I was English when she checked my passport. She's a little
strange, but very accommodating and she ensured that my bike was secure and
inside (she wouldn't let me leave it in the car park locked up). She called my
"Thomas" for a good while, which was fine, until she asked if that was my
name, and I said "Daniel, but Thomas is also fine!".</p>

<p>She later entered the bar holding her cat "Daniel!" (she starts most
sentences addressing me with either "Thomas!" or, now, "Daniel!") This is my
cat, tiger" (or similar).</p>

<p>The room is quite expensive, €38, including breakfast. I had hoped to pay more
in the line of €20, and I probably wouldn't have stopped if I had known the
price (the campsite should be just another 100m down the road). But it's fine,
I only paid €4 for the campsite last night and the breakfast should be good
for the push tomorrow to Riga.</p>

<p>After crashing out for an hour, I came down to the bar and ordered dinner -
explaining that I was vegetarian, I was going to order chips and cheese, but
instead the lady recommended dumplings. In the end I had dumplings with
mayonnaise, a beer, and some bread.</p>

<p>I will stay at least 2 nights in Riga, the length of time I spend depends on
how much I like the hostel (assuming I find one), I would be quite happy to
spend a bit more time there if it's good.</p>

<p>My bum is sore to the point approaching uncomfortability for the first time,
perhaps it's the accumulation of the past two weeks, or just doing two 8 hour
days back-to-back.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The campsite is almost empty and again it's a big one sponsered by the EU.
When I arrived at 18:00 it was empty and I thought it was closed, but I took
the phone number anyway and went to the next campsite on my map 3km down the
road, on arriving there I passed what seemed to be a deer enclosure and there
was a huge stag sitting in the middle of it. There were <em>lots</em> of people at
this place, it seemed like a recreation area, and the campsite was full and I
could hear the "thump thump thump" of club music. I didn't like this, and
thought I would ring the other campsite, someone picked up and said they would
be there in one minute. When I arrived there were already 4 cars in the
parking area, just 20 minutes after I had first arrived. The campsite cost €4
and the guy who was managing it told me there was a shop just around the
corned and I picked up some beers.</p>

<p><em>Stag</em></p>

<p>This morning I woke up in the dormitory after a good nights sleep and went
down to the kitchen where the hostel guy was making croissants, and the old
korean was sitting at the table. He complained jokingly that the hostel guy
was chucking him out on the street "He put me out on the street, and old guy
like me" "I found you a room in another hostel!, we are fully booked" "On the
street!" the Korean said with a grin.</p>

<p>I waited for the croissants and Stefan joined and I packed my stuff and said
thanks to the hostel guy, he was a very sympatic man and obvsiously enjoyed
what he was doing, and I think he also ran a bigger hostel in town.</p>

<p>It was good to meet Stefan, who was now going to fly back to Berlin. He is an
experienced cycle tourer, and his first tour was riding across Africa when he
was 19, and has done a dozen since, both alone and with friends. We had
developed many of the same habits with regards to touring, and it was good to
chat, and I expect I'll see him again in Berlin.</p>

<p>Vilnius is quite a big city and it took some time to weave my way out of it
and make my way north. There was a head wind for the first time, although not
very strong, strong enough to contiually rush past my ears and distrurb my
music.</p>

<p>The weather forcast was also good for today, and although the clounds looked
primed to yield rain in the morning, they didn't and it was the sunniest day
for a week, although by far cooler than the first day.</p>

<p>I planned to follow the minor road to Utena - a place where I had assumed I
could find accomodation. I read that it was increasingly popular with tourists
(and the other sobreing thing that Wikipedia said about the town was that
2,000 jews were rounded up and shot uner the Nazis during World War II).</p>

<p><em>Green</em></p>

<p>The major A road, was under construction however, so the minor road had much
more traffic initially than I had expected, but as I passed a few junctions
most traffic left the road, and soon it was quiet.</p>

<p>The road didn't go all the way to Utena, and I had to cut across some country
and forest roads. The country side was very peaceful and rich, and there was
the constant sound of Cicadas in the long grass.</p>

<p>For lunch I thought I would stop in the town of Molėtai, and I went to the
supermarket and picked up some bread and a drink, and then carried on looking
for a bench, but I left the town without finding one. About 5km later I found
a lonely bus stop, and had a picnic there.</p>

<p><em>Lunch</em></p>

<p>Arriving in Utena I headed to what I assumed was a "hotel", but when I arrived
it was a guest house, and cost €35 (I didn't speak to anybody, but checked on
the internet). I had assumed there was a hostel here, and failing that some
hotels, but there was nothing, only more expensive guest houses (2 of them).
Looking at the map I saw a campsite 10km further on and left Utena.</p>

<p>So as mentioned at the beginning, it was empty I checked out the other
campsite didn't like it and came back.</p>

<p><em>The road</em></p>

<p>Whilst writing this blog post a couple has setup 20m from my tent.</p>

<p>This is likely my last night in Lithuania, depending on if I head north or
north-west, my next checkpoint is the capital of Latvia which is about another
200k from here depending on the route.</p>

<p>My language learning is not going to well, I haven't managed to use anything
I have learnt in the wild, only saying "Achu" occasionally, but then it often
feels better to offer full disclosure and say "Thankyou". Latvia is related to
Lithuanian, but the hostel guy said that they Lithuanians and Latvians could
not understand one another, and the words for "hello", "goodbye" and (I think)
"thankyou" are different, so it will be back to square one.</p>
