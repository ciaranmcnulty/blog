        <div>
            <p>I'm sitting in the Eurphoria hostel in Tallinn, I got in around an hour and a
half ago, and have briefly explored the tourist saturated center, then came
back here and played guitar and piano for about an hour and a guy just came in
and sat at the drums. There is all the tools required for a band in this room,
which is one of the reasons I was attracted to this hostel, and I may be
staying here for a week.</p>

<p>I slept well last night and before sleeping watched the final two episodes of
Game of Thrones, and the <em>ending</em> wasn't as bad as I feared. This morning I
woke up hungry, which accorded with the number of kilometers I made yesterday,
I went out to the shop, but it was 8:30 and not open until 10, so I used the
hostel kitchen to make a breakfast with what I had: porridge, jam, partially
melted cheese slices and coffee.</p>

<p>It was now only 70k to Tallinn on the main road, and I guessed 100k by taking
some of the diversions through the Lahemaa National Park. I would now
certainly be staying in Tallinn this night, and so I researched hostels on
<code>hostelworld.com</code> and chose the Euphoria hostel (there were a number of nice
looking hostels, but the fact that Euphoria had a piano and a guitar swung it
for me), I phoned ahead and made sure they could store my bike, and booked
(online, as they weren't keen on booking me over the phone).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/1.JPG" alt="Recommended" /></p>

<p><em>The much recommended Project Kodu, which I passed, but I could have cycled
an extra 21k yesterday and stayed here if I had known</em></p>

<p>I left the hostel, dropping the keys at the post office next door - as
instructed - and when I handed the keys to the man behind the counter he
looked very confused, and pointed to the hostel next door, I insisted that I
had been asked to leave the keys here, and he went inside and fetched a lady -
possibly the very same who I met the previous evening - who understood and
took the keys - I honestly can't remember if it was the same lady or not.</p>

<p>I then rode out of Vosu and continued my journey through the national park.
Despite the road looking like it was following the coast, there were very few
occasions where I could actually see the sea, and the majority of the route
was the same -- trees lining each side of the road. But it was very quiet,
especially after I had a mantrum at my phone's audio player and decided it
wasn't worth the effort and unplugged it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/2.JPG" alt="Smoke on the water" /></p>

<p><em>Smoke on the water</em></p>

<p>I had given up on my MP3 player, and thought I'd try playing music from my
phone, but the phone's audio player was incredibly, to my eyes, badly
designed. All it has to do, according to me, is play files, organised by
folders, sorted by filenames - but no. It does no such thing, it probably does
just about everything else, but not that. So I lost my temper and was cursing
my phone for being so shitting stupid, and when I finally listened to music I
was in no mood, so I unplugged it and the rest of my day was silent.</p>

<p>When I did finally pass some coast I looked out across the Baltic sea to
Finland (I was mistaken) , and could see a column of cloud rising on the
horizon, it first occurred to me that it was smoke and something was on fire,
but then it was the wrong colour for smoke, so I guessed it was steam, and my
guess was confirmed later - I was looking at some kind of power plant outside
of Tallinn.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/3.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>Road</em></p>

<p>It was hot today, and as I started to feel thirsty, and then hungry (more so
for the longer day yesterday), I wanted an energy drink, in previous tours it
was beer, this time it's energy drinks, I need something at least slightly
malevolent for lunch, and I couldn't find a shop, eventually I realised that I
had a can of baked beans at least, and that would be more than enough for
lunch - all I needed now was a bench.</p>

<p>As it happened the next bench was 15km away - which is always the case - and
there was also a shop, so I got both an energy drink, some bread and 4
individually wrapped chocolates. I sat down on a bench outside of the close-by
post office and ate the beans, the bread, the chocolates and a pint of energy
drink, and then read a chapter of the book, and I was quite full.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/4.JPG" alt="Source of the smoke" /></p>

<p><em>Source of the smoke</em></p>

<p>Coming into Tallinn, there was the EuroVelo route, but it seemed unnecessarily
complex, and I tried to follow the main road, which was at this point dual
carriageway, but there were smaller roads either side with cycle paths, but
these were awful to cycle on, continuing only for half a kilometer before
turning one way or another and no clear indication of where they were going,
making me frustrated - I just wanted to follow a road for 4km - so in the end
I joined the now 3-lane dual carriage way, there were no signs prohibiting
cyclists, so I guess this was fine, if not comfortable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/5.JPG" alt="TV tower" /></p>

<p><em>TV tower, similar to the one in Berlin</em></p>

<p>The hostel I arrived at easily enough and checked in, there were already
people playing music.</p>

<p>I have just played for about another hour, and now when writing this blog some
guy has pulled out his saxophone accompanied by picked chords on an electric
guitar, it's jazz and it sounds as amazing as a saxophone does cutting into
the empty air.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-23/6.JPG" alt="View on Tallinn" /></p>

<p><em>View on the old town close to the hostel</em></p>

<p>This is potentially my last post, this was my original destination. I just
found out that the ferry to Helsinki is not as expensive as I thought (maybe
only €20) but the ferry to Trevemunde will be much more expensive, so I will
likely get the bus, but will see what happens in the next week - which is a
long time.</p>

            <p>I had prepared for a long day today, and after two days at the Looming hostel
in Tartu I was feeling fresh and ready to go in this morning. I had had some
good chats with people at the hostel, and the experience was running through
my mind for the first few hours of the trip this morning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/1.JPG" alt="Tortu" /></p>

<p><em>Tortu's main square this morning</em></p>

<p>The weather was fine as I left the hostel and headed down to the river, and I
felt good. I had planned to do 150k today, the town of Rakvere was the
logical stop at around the 100k mark, but there were no hotels under €50 and
no campsites, so I had decided to continue to the coast and hope that the
campsite on my map was existing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/2.JPG" alt="Lake" /></p>

<p><em>Lake with church behind trees</em></p>

<p>There was a meandering EuroVelo cycle route from Tartu to Talinn, this route
heads up to the coast before heading east to Tallinn. I decided instead to
stick to the main road however, approximating the main points of route and
throughout the day I was either crossing the cycle route, or breifly joining
it before regaining the main road, there were some exceptions where the cycle
route was more direct, or equidistant to the main road, but the most part I
stuck to the main road.</p>

<p>Cycling today was surprisingly easy, and I managed to keep an average speed of
just over 20kmph for the whole day, I listened to the random songs on my MP3
player for about 6-7 hours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/3.JPG" alt="Road" /></p>

<p><em>75% of today was like this</em></p>

<p>I stopped after 50km (energy drink and cake), and then at 100km (at Väike
Maarga) for lunch (another energy drink, a cheese/peanut-butter/nuts sandwich,
and half a bar of chocolate. On both stops I read a chapter from Jane Eyre.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/4.JPG" alt="Square outside the town hallin Rackvere" /></p>

<p><em>Square outside the town hall in Väike Maarja</em></p>

<p>I cycled around Rakvere at around 120k, passing a cemetery for German
soldiers, which was part of a <a href="https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/3638/German-War-Cemetery-Wesenberg---Rakvere.htm">German military
hospital</a>
during World War II.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/5.JPG" alt="Cemetary" /></p>

<p><em>Cemetary for German Soldiers</em></p>

<p>At one point I cycled past a couple and a man held out his arm at me, but I
didn't understand the gesture, he was not waving or putting is thumb up, and
didn't seem to be smiling, but he was looking directly at me. I slowed down
and he said something to me in Estonian, which at least didn't sound
particularly threatening, I said "I don't understand..." at which point he
turned around and I carried on and wondered for the next quarter of an hour if
he meant to impart some important knowledge to me, but nothing significant
happened on the subsequent road except around 10km of road works, which in ,
this case, weren't very disruptive. There were no traffic lights, only
yellow-jacketed men waving cars past, and who would wave me past
unconditionally. Most of the road was open despite the resurfacing.</p>

<p>About 20km from the campsite I noticed that I had a choice between 3
campsites, one was the original one I had aimed for, which was north east, the
other two were north-west. By taking the north-west option I would perhaps
miss some of the coast, but having two campsites on the map meant that my
accommodation options would be more secure for tonight, so I chose the
north-west ones. These were actually slightly further away, and I was also
glad that this would make my day at least 163km - a number which is
significant to me because it is 100 miles, and would be the first "century" I
have done in some years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/6.JPG" alt="Main street in Rakvere" /></p>

<p><em>Main street in Rakvere</em></p>

<p>I was, I noticed, riding through the Lahemaa National Park, which had been
recommended to me on a few times, once by a girl in Riga, and the other time
just last night by two or three separate people. I wasn't particularly
interested in being here however, I think it's more popular for hiking and
such things, I would like to see the coast, but as it turns out you can't see
it from the road at all.</p>

<p>The first campsite I arrived at was a free campsite. There was nobody there,
but it was clearly indicated that you could camp, and light a fire. There was
firewood, dry or chemical toilets and a sheltered, long, table. It seemed
lonely and a four wheel drive stopped at the entrance while I cycled into
investigate and I had the (surely wrong) impression that I was being watched.
I decided to check out the other campsite first, although this one seemed
ideally ideal, it didn't have Wifi - at least that was my excuse.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/7.JPG" alt="First campsite" /></p>

<p><em>Open campsite</em></p>

<p>The next campsite on my map didn't exist at all, there was no trace of it in
the village where it was situated, I could go back to the free campsite or
carry on another 13km to the next settlement which had a number of campsites
and a hostel.</p>

<p>I was now clearly breaking into my all time top 10 touring rides for distance,
but the time wasn't very extreme (by contrast I think I've had rides some 
years previous of 13 hours achieving 160km or less).</p>

<p>When I entered the town I perked up at the idea of staying in a hostel,
presumably full with hikers and outdoor people, and as it's in a village there
would surely be an opportunity to get a pizza and some beer.</p>

<p>I almost didn't stay at the hostel, it was only by chance that when I wheeled
up and opened the door the owner was in the kitchen to meet a repairman - I
think if she were not there I would not have gone to the effort of phoning -
it wasn't a "hostel" hostel, it was more of a guest-house with communal
facilities.</p>

<p>When she told me the price was €30 part of me said "No!" and the other part
felt committed already and was looking forward to the pizza. I said I'd think
about it and went outside and studied my map for a minute, if only to see the
campsite just 1km down the road which I knew was there, and I decided to stay.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/9.JPG" alt="Beach" /></p>

<p><em>Beach at Vosu</em></p>

<p>"What time will you leave?" "err, 8 or 9" "If you leave at 9, then leave the
key in the post office next door" She didn't give me an option for leaving
before 9.</p>

<p>I felt bad until she showed me the room, it is a spacious minimal room with a
terrace with two beds, so now all I needed was that pizza. So I left, the
first restaurant had none, only a "vegetarian option" of fries and some
vegetables. The next was only slightly better by offering pasta and feta
cheese, for €5. I ordered a beer too, and was surprised that that put the
price at €9! The pasta was none that good also, and the croutons which were
spread over the top were stale.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-22/10.JPG" alt="Hostel" /></p>

<p><em>The hostel</em></p>

<p>Still, the supermarket is open (I hope), and there is (I hope) Wifi at the
hostel, and I should be able to retire with a few beers and maybe I can finish
watching Game of Thrones and see how everybody lives happily ever after.</p>

<p>Tomorrow should be my last bike ride (or at least I can easily cover the
remaining distance to Tallinn in one day). I should have about 1 week in
Tallinn unless I decide to return to Berlin early.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I intended to stay two nights in Tartu, but have ended up staying three. There
seem to be no logical resting places for tomorrows journey within a 120km
distance (other than hotels which I would consider to be beyond what I'd be
happy to pay), and the next campsite is on the coast, which would be 155km - a
long day. The following day I could do an even longer day and make it all the
way to Talinn, which is either 100km direct, or, if following the coast (and I
really should follow the coast) it's almost 163km, 100 miles and this last
act of masochism seems fitting for the last journey on this trip, although
there is also an outdoor "hostel" or "retreat" in the forest outside of
Tallinn which has been recommended to me twice, so that may break my journey.</p>

<p>In Tartu I got drunk the first night with a guy who was here for Metallica
concert (to be fair it was mainly me doing the drinking, he was waiting to get
the bus back at 2am), the next day I went for a run.</p>

<p>Tartu is situated on a river and has a few parks on it's south bank, and I was
able to run through these parks and then back along the river bank, over the
bridge in the center of town and then along the other side to another bridge.
The weather has been very fine, and there were very few people to be found
outside of the town (just a couple of people fishing, and the occasional
jogger).</p>

<p>Inside the town on my first day it was uncomfortably packed, as there was some
kind of "Medieval" festival happening, but when I found myself in the throng
of the crowd, my instinct was to remove myself as quickly as possibly, the
only medieval thing I saw was a single lost-looking woman in a medieval
(or Tudor) costume. But I'm told by some of the hostel guests that it really
was a lot of fun.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tallinn/2019-07-21/1.png" alt="Cathedral" /></p>

<p><em>Ruined cathedral in Tartu (from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<p>Other than this I have been making solid efforts on my programming project,
which is rather starting to annoy me now, and I'm wonder at the amount of time
I have spent on this thing (it has been in the works since March). I hope it's
finished to a useful state soon and provides some redeeming value.</p>

<p>Last night I researched books to read, I'm currently reading "The Castle", an
unfinished novel by Franz Kafka, but after 150 pages, not really enjoying it.
I found a list of 100 books to read before you die, the top one was "To kill a
mockingbird", which I already read, the second was "Pride and Prejudice",
which I hadn't (and somehow it doesn't appeal to me), and somewhere on the
list I found "Jane Eyre", which I happened to have on my ebook device, so I'm
starting with that now.</p>

<p>I am now sitting in the hostel after having eaten my breakfast and am about to
leave, the weather has been excellent for the past two days, but today it
looks to rain and I can fill the cool air blowing through the open window to
my back.</p>
