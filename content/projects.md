By far the two biggest projects I'm responsible for are:

- [Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor): PHP Language Server.
- [PhpBench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench): PHP Benchmarking and performance tool.

But I've written smaller projects which are actively used:

- [Fink](https://github.com/dantleech/fink): Link checker.
- [What Changed](https://github.com/dantleech/what-changed): Composer plugin to see what changed.
- [Gherkin Lint](https://github.com/dantleech/gherkin-lint-php): Gherkin  Linter

Going back further in time:

- [PHPCRShell](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-shell): Shell for PHPCR (PHP version of the JCR content repository).
- [Symfony CMF Routing Auto](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/routing-auto) CMF component to automatically generate and manage routes.
