Another DIY breakfast. Light rain when we set out with coffee at Vielle St Giron. Dan received phone call from hotel booked the previous night to say reception was closed from 3 to 6pm. We aimed to go fast and arrive before 3pm and did so comfortably including a quick lunch at Souston. Started to watch film Abraham Lincoln on laptop but gave up because of poor sound quality. 62 miles.
