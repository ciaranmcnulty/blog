My name is Daniel Leech. I am PHP developer since 2007. I live mostly in
Berlin.

I created [a benchmarking framework](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) and
[a PHP completion and refactoring tool](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor)
and was previously active in the [Symfony CMF
project](https://cmf.symfony.com) and related PHPCR ecosystem. I worked on the
[Sulu CMF](https://sulu.io) for a year or so.

Currently work at [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com).

Interested in stuff and can be found on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dantleech) and
